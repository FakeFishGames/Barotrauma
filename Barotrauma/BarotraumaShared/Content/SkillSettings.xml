<!-- 
SingleRoundSkillGainMultiplier:
  All skill gains are multiplied when playing a single round (i.e. any other game mode than campaign) 
  
SkillIncreasePerRepair:
  Skill gained for repairing a device. Divided by the character's current skill, 
  so a character with a skill level 10 will be able to increase the skill twice as fast as a lvl 20 character.
  
SkillIncreasePerSabotage:
  Skill gained for sabotaging a device as a traitor. Works the same as SkillIncreasePerRepair.
  
SkillIncreasePerCprRevive:
  Skill gained when reviving someone with CPR. 
  
SkillIncreasePerRepairedStructureDamage:
  Skill gained per amount of repaired structure damage. Divided by the character's current skill.
  
SkillIncreasePerSecondWhenSteering:
  Skill gained per second when operating a nav terminal. Divided by the character's current skill. Multiplied by velocity vector squared.
  For example, at 50% speed a value of 0.001 would mean a character with a helm skill of 10 gains 0.005 skill by second (0.3 per minute).
  
SkillIncreasePerFabricatorRequiredSkill:
  Skill gained when fabricating an item. Multiplied by the skill requirements of fabricating the item,
  and divided by the character's current skill. For example, if fabricating an item requires a mechanical skill of 50,
  and this value is set to 2, and a character with a mechanical skill of 25 fabricates the item, their skill increases by 2 * 50 / 25^1.5 = 0.8.
  Repeated for every skill requirement.
  
SkillIncreasePerHostileDamage
  Skill gained when damaging an enemy. Multiplied by the damage done to the enemy, divided by the character's current skill.
  For example, a value of 0.7 would mean killing an enemy with 100 health when your current skill is 25 would increase the skill by 0.7 * 100 / 25^1.5 = 0.56
  
SkillIncreasePerSecondWhenOperatingTurret
  Skill gained per second when manning a turret. Divided by the character's current skill.
  For example, a value of 0.001 would mean a character with a weapons skill of 10 gains 0.01 skill by second (0.6 per minute).
  
SkillIncreasePerFriendlyHealed
  Skill gained per second when healing other members of your crew. Multiplied the amount of damage you heal, divided by the character's current skill.
  For example, a value of 0.7 would mean healing a character from 0 to 100 with a medical skill of 25 increases the skill by 0.7 * 100 / 25^1.5 = 0.56
  
AssistantSkillIncreaseMultiplier
  Multiplier to skill gains when playing as an assistant. For example, a value of 1.5 would make assistants gain skills 50% faster than other classes.
  
SkillIncreaseExponent
  Increased skill diminishes skill gains returns by this exponent. All skill increases are divided by the skill level ^ 1.5
