  <!-- Loading Screen tips -->
  <loadingscreentip>You will not get paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Letting the submarine's nuclear reactor overheat may cause fires. If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The cephalopod-like watchers are generally docile, but may attack when provoked.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Mud raptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Morbusine is a neurotoxin potent enough to take down even some of the largest Europan predators. A trained medical doctor can manufacture it relatively easily using a medical fabricator.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the number of doses a single syringe provides, and may also reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Be careful not to dive too deep. Most submarine hulls will start collapsing at the depth of approximately 2,000 meters.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</loadingscreentip>

  <!-- Submarine names & descriptions -->
  <submarine.name.humpback>Humpback</submarine.name.humpback>
  <submarine.description.humpback>A former military vessel, WH4-L3 'Humpback' has been outfitted to withstand most of the dangers in deep Europa. Her relatively high velocity is offset by low maneuverability. As she's still boasting an older model reactor, power needs to be supplemented by a backup battery array or the crew will find themselves unable to run all of the new equipment.</submarine.description.humpback>
  <submarine.name.bunyip>Bunyip</submarine.name.bunyip>
  <submarine.description.bunyip>Latest in the line of personnel transports, Bunyip is capable of ferrying crew between submarines and installations. Its operating radius is considerably lower than its more advanced cousins and no weapons on board makes it vulnerable to attacks.</submarine.description.bunyip>
  <submarine.name.muikku>Muikku</submarine.name.muikku>
  <submarine.description.muikku>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.muikku>
  <submarine.name.orca>Orca</submarine.name.orca>
  <submarine.description.orca>With a relatively high top speed and fantastic ascent and descent characteristics due to her 3 large ballast tanks, Orca class subs are agile vessels, let down only by their small compliment of weapons, unreliable engine and reactors with a greater than average hunger for fuel.</submarine.description.orca>
  <submarine.name.remora>Remora</submarine.name.remora>
  <submarine.description.remora>A range of customization options are available for Remora. In this model, some of the main hull space has been replaced by a detachable ballast and a remote-controlled drone. A large crew is needed to operate this submarine.</submarine.description.remora>
  <submarine.name.typhon>Typhon</submarine.name.typhon>
  <submarine.description.typhon>Typhon class subs are known for their brutish appearance, reasonable array of light and heavy firepower, and their general dependability. Any captain should be aware of their poor rate of descent and unimpressive top speed.</submarine.description.typhon>
  <submarine.name.dugong>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong>
  <submarine.description.dugong>Compared to larger vessels, the Dugong series is overshadowed in all aspects except one: their reliability for their price is world class. They're lacking in firepower and speed, so smart maneuvering is key.</submarine.description.dugong>
  <submarine.name.selkie>Selkie</submarine.name.selkie>
  <submarine.description.selkie>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.selkie>
  <submarine.name.venture>Venture</submarine.name.venture>
  <submarine.description.venture>Originally intended as research vessels, Venture shuttles have been co-opted as a more robust alternative for travel between outposts and submarines.</submarine.description.venture>
  <submarine.name.berilia>Berilia</submarine.name.berilia>
  <submarine.description.berilia>Berilia is top of the line when it comes to mass and firepower. Its two engines and three ballasts require a copious amount of power to operate, and keeping the machinery in condition is a handful for even a moderately large crew.</submarine.description.berilia>
  <submarine.name.kastrull>Kastrull</submarine.name.kastrull>
  <submarine.description.kastrull>The Kastrull is a dependable attack sub class bringing plenty of firepower to any fight, and although it's not very nimble, it does sport a drone gunship as standard. Keep in mind that with its experimental open ballast tanks, low tolerance to flooding and numerous crew stations, a large, experienced crew will get the most out of this sub.</submarine.description.kastrull>

  <tutorial.mechanictitle>Mechanic - Glue, duct tape and your nerve are the only things keeping the crew alive.</tutorial.mechanictitle>
  <tutorial.mechanicdescription>When the plan goes as planned and the gear works is as probable as the human race leaving this shithole. There are no breaks or rest for you, as everything that can break down, will break down. And if nothing’s broken, then it's maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Getting to the next destination is all that matters, and you’re the one who delivers. There’s no thank-yous or respect, just snickering and contempt from your fellow crew members—but that’s okay. This is YOUR survival vessel, and if any of them make it too, well...whoop dee doo for them.</tutorial.mechanicdescription>

  <tutorial.engineerdescription>Power and oxygen, it's like that. Without, the ship don’t move and the lungs won’t breathe. Beyond the fancy talk and costume play, you are the guy who really runs the ship, get it? Trust in the laws of physics and think clear. Also, keep your eye on that damn toy-tinkering wannabe engineer mechanic, and whatever you do, don’t bite into the psycho-babble of the medic. He’s so deep in his softie inner world he’s practically a woman. Captain and security are harmless, and way below your intelligence. Obviously.</tutorial.engineerdescription>

  <tutorial.securityofficerdescription>It is said that pressure brings out the worst in people. Not everybody has your moral strength—hell, most of them are so crooked that it’s questionable if they even should be allowed to live. Channel the crew’s anger toward the creatures outside, but never fool yourself into trusting them.

  <!-- Tutorial extras -->
  <tutorial.airlocktitle>Airlock</tutorial.airlocktitle>
  <tutorial.airlockdescription>Every submarine should be equipped with a secure airlock where the crew can exit the sub safely and without too much flooding.\n\nTo safely exit the submarine, equip a diving suit and other necessary items (usually a handheld sonar, weapons and extra oxygen tank or two). Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\n\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine. It is also helpful to return all of the equipment back to their proper places and refill used oxygen tanks at the oxygen generator.</tutorial.airlockdescription>
  <tutorial.railguntitle>Railgun</tutorial.railguntitle>
  <tutorial.railgundescription>The railgun works like a coil gun, except it fires big shells that can be upgraded with explosives.\n\nRailgun loaders are loaded with single railgun shells instead of boxes of ammunition. Otherwise, operating them is the same: interact with the periscope to aim with the turret, then press {0} to fire. Press {1} to stop aiming.</tutorial.railgundescription>
  <tutorial.syringeguntitle>Syringe gun</tutorial.syringeguntitle>
  <tutorial.syringegundescription>A ranged weapon of choice for medics, the syringe gun uses medicine as ammunition. This allows for administering cures from afar. Be aware: medicines fired from long range are less effective than those used in the medical interface.\n\nA tactical choice in combat would be to load the syringe gun with poison and fire it at enemies. Aim the syringe gun the same way you would other long-range weapons: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.</tutorial.syringegundescription>
  <tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>Plasma cutter</tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>
  <tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>The plasma cutter is a device used to cut through walls and doors. It functions like the welding tool: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.\n\nWhile the plasma cutter is primarily a tool, it does inflict burns on anyone who gets in the way, which makes it a handy makeshift weapon.</tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>
  <tutorial.crowbartitle>Crowbar</tutorial.crowbartitle>
  <tutorial.crowbardescription>A heavy instrument that can be used to force open doors. Handy when someone has been tampering with door wiring or when you need to get to rooms you’re not allowed in. Use ({0}) the crowbar on a closed door to start prying it open. The crowbar must be equipped to do this.</tutorial.crowbardescription>
  <tutorial.mineralstitle>Minerals</tutorial.mineralstitle>
  <tutorial.mineralsdescription>The basic materials for crafting can be bought, deconstructed or found in the world.\n\nMinerals are spawned in the cave and ice walls, and they can be cut out using the plasma cutter and then picked up. Raw minerals can be deconstructed to create craftable elements.</tutorial.mineralsdescription>
  <tutorial.psychosistitle>Psychosis</tutorial.psychosistitle>
  <tutorial.psychosisdescription>When in contact with certain performance-enhancing drugs or under some extraterrestrial influence, players may be afflicted with psychosis, causing them to experience visual and auditory hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nPsychosis may be cured using haloperidol.</tutorial.psychosisdescription>
  <tutorial.opiatestitle>Opiate addiction and withdrawals</tutorial.opiatestitle>
  <tutorial.opiatesdescription>Overuse of pain medication causes addiction and, in time, withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by feeding the addiction, but to truly be rid of the effects, one must either stop taking the drugs entirely or use naloxone.</tutorial.opiatesdescription>
  <tutorial.oxygentitle>Oxygen</tutorial.oxygentitle>
  <tutorial.oxygendescription>Oxygen is a valuable commodity in underwater Europa. It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>
  <tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>
  <tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}. Use {1} and {2} buttons to climb the ladder. Let go of the ladder by pressing {3} again.</tutorial.ladderdescription>

  <engineer.reactortext>Nuclear reactors provide power to submarines and outposts. They require fuel to create heat and a crew member to regulate the output.\n\nDrag a fuel rod to the item slot on the left side. Multiple fuel rods create more heat, but in normal circumstances one is enough and any more might lead to overheating.\n\nStart by setting the fission rate so that the needle is on green, then do the same for turbine output. You can see load and output values to the right. Try to keep the output as close to load as possible. When the output is lower it leads to power outages and, when it’s higher, overvoltage and fires.\n\nWhen the reactor operator leaves the interface, it’s recommended to turn automatic control on.

  <officer.crawler>Crawlers</officer.crawler>
  <officer.crawlerobjective>Kill the crawler</officer.crawlerobjective>
  <officer.crawlertext>There's a monster in the next room. A crawler. Take it down using the stun baton. Stun baton stuns enemies for a brief moment, so use that to your advantage.</officer.crawlertext>

  <officer.somethingbig>Coilgun, part 1</officer.somethingbig>
  <officer.somethingbigobjective>Load coilgun and turn on the supercapacitor</officer.somethingbigobjective>
  <officer.somethingbigtext>Coilguns are standard-issue equipment in most subs. They require short bursts of power and boxes of ammunition.\n\nTo ready the coilgun, you must make sure the supercapacitor has enough power by setting the recharge rate high enough (50% is usually enough), then insert full ammunition boxes into the coilgun loader.\n\nThe ammo boxes loaded in the coilguns seem empty. You need to unload them. Do this by dragging the empty boxes away from the loader. Drop the empty boxes on the ground by holding the green arrow above the ammo box when it's equipped.\n\nAmmo boxes are large and unwieldy. You must use two hands to carry one and they can’t be carried around in the inventory. To drop an ammo box, either drag it away from your equip slot or press the unequip button on top of the equip slot.</officer.somethingbigtext>
  <officer.hammerhead>Coilgun, part 2</officer.hammerhead>
  <officer.hammerheadobjective>Kill the attacking hammerhead</officer.hammerheadobjective>
  <officer.hammerheadtext>To use the coilgun, interact ({0}) with the periscope. While on the periscope, aim with the mouse and fire by pressing {1}. To stop aiming, press {2}.\n\nThe gun uses a lot of power, so firing conservatively is key. Otherwise the supercapacitor may not be able to keep up.</officer.hammerheadtext>

  <!-- Room 5 -->
  <officer.rangedweapon>Ranged weapons</officer.rangedweapon>
  <officer.rangedweaponobjective>Grab some ranged weapons</officer.rangedweaponobjective>
  <officer.rangedweapontext>Ranged weapons work the same way as melee weapons, except their accuracy is more dependent on the character’s weapons skill. Aim with {0} and fire with {1}.\n\nThey must also be loaded with ammunition. Hover the mouse cursor over a ranged weapon to see how many bullets, harpoons, etc. are contained. Drop ammunition into the slots or on the weapon itself to load the weapon.</officer.rangedweapontext>

  <!-- Room 6 -->
  <officer.mudraptor>Mudraptors</officer.mudraptor>
  <officer.mudraptorobjective>Kill the mudraptor</officer.mudraptorobjective>
  <officer.mudraptortext>Mudraptors are bigger, meaner and more armored than crawlers. Taking them down requires more firepower. Aim for the mouth or belly and try to keep your distance.</officer.mudraptortext>

  <officer.armsubmarineobjective>Ready coilguns</officer.armsubmarineobjective>
  <officer.armsubmarinetext>Find ammunition for the coilguns and load them. Recharge supercapacitors.\n\nIn most submarines, gun loaders and supercapacitors are located next to their respective gun controls. A value of 50% for supercapacitors’ recharge is usually enough to keep them ready for monster encounters. Set it to 100% when a lot of firing is expected.</officer.armsubmarinetext>

You can inspect different limbs by clicking on them.\n\nTo treat an affliction, drag a medical item onto the highlighted area. Suggested items are shown in the interface, but caution must be exercised, since some characters’ medical skills aren’t high enough to suggest the correct treatment. In this case, you have some light internal damage. Morphine is effective in treating this affliction.</doctor.firstaidselftext>

  <captain.navigateobjective>Navigate to destination</captain.navigateobjective>
  <captain.navigatetext>Plot a course for the submarine by clicking on the sonar display. The navigation terminal will adjust the ballast and engine’s force accordingly and automatically.\n\nTo see where the sub is heading, turn on active sonar. Do that by finding the sonar settings next to the display and setting it from “passive” to “active”.\n\nMove carefully. The faster the submarine moves, the more difficult it will be to slow it down. Colliding with cave walls will damage the hull and cause leaks. For tutorial purposes, this sub will be protected against hull breaches.</captain.navigatetext>
  <captain.dock>Docking</captain.dock>
  <captain.dockobjective>Dock with destination outpost</captain.dockobjective>
  <captain.docktext>To dock the submarine, maneuver the ship’s and outpost’s docking ports close to each other and toggle the docking clamps. Ports are displayed in green on the sonar display.\n\nWhen the ports are close to each other, a line will be shown on the sonar display—use that to your advantage. When the line is fully green, close the clamps by pressing “toggle docking”. The submarine will then be locked into position, and the docking hatch will be open for as long as the docking clamps are engaged.\n\nWhen positioning the submarine for docking, radical movements can easily cause you to overshoot your target. Move slowly and carefully to avoid colliding with the outpost. Using autopilot and “maintain position” is helpful in setting the position you want the submarine to move to.</captain.docktext>

  <campaigndisclaimertitle>Welcome to Barotrauma!</campaigndisclaimertitle>
  <campaigndisclaimertext>Please note that Barotrauma is still in Early Access, and that many aspects of the game are incomplete and still being worked on.\n\nThe Campaign Mode is still lacking many of the features we've planned for the full version, and is not yet as enjoyable as the multiplayer. In the current version, playing the game solo can also be more challenging to new players than playing it with other people—even though the AI crew can give you a hand with some tasks, they are usually not as useful as real human players. If you're interested in what's to come in future updates, click the Campaign Roadmap button below.\n\nWe do, however, recommend that you at least play the single-player tutorial before diving into the multiplayer. Good luck, sailor!</campaigndisclaimertext>
  <campaignroadmaptitle>Campaign Roadmap</campaignroadmaptitle>
  <campaignroadmaptext>- Explorable locations: As of now, the locations on the campaign map are essentially just menus where you can buy supplies and hire new crew members, but during the Early Access period they will become actual physical locations you can enter and explore.\n\n- Expanded story: You will be able to learn more about the world of Barotrauma by interacting with NPCs and by exploring the outposts and non-man-made locations.\n\n- New mission types: We have plans for several completely new mission types, including personnel transport missions and salvage missions into shipwrecks.\n\n- Balancing: Currently the campaign economy is not very well balanced, but we will start to put more focus into it when we have more of the content in.\n\n- End goal: At the moment it’s not possible to complete the campaign, but in future versions the mysterious location at the center of the map will become reachable...</campaignroadmaptext>
