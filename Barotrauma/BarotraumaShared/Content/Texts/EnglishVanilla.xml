  <!-- Loading Screen tips -->
  <loadingscreentip>You will not get paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Letting the submarine's nuclear reactor overheat may cause fires. If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The cephalopod-like watchers are generally docile, but may attack when provoked.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Mud raptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Morbusine is a neurotoxin potent enough to take down even some of the largest Europan predators. A trained medical doctor can manufacture it relatively easily using a medical fabricator.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the number of doses a single syringe provides, and may also reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Be careful not to dive too deep. Most submarine hulls will start collapsing at the depth of approximately 2,000 meters.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</loadingscreentip>
  <loadingscreentip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</loadingscreentip>

  <disconnectedturretswarning>The submarine contains [itemname]s which haven't been linked to an ammunition loader. Select the item and click a loader while holding space to link them.</disconnectedturretswarning>
  <nowaypointswarning>No waypoints found in the submarine. AI controlled crew members won't be able to navigate without waypoints.</nowaypointswarning>
  <nocargospawnpointwarning>The submarine does not have spawnpoints for cargo (which are used for determining where to place bought items). To fix this, create a new spawnpoint and change its spawn type' parameter to 'cargo'.</nocargospawnpointwarning>
  <farawayentitieswarning>One or more structures/items have been placed very far from the submarine. Do you want to move the camera to them?</farawayentitieswarning>
  <adjustlightsprompt>This submarine was saved using an older version of Barotrauma, which used a different formula to calculate lighting. The lighting in the submarine may now appear too bright. Do you want to automatically readjust the lighting for the new lighting formula?</adjustlightsprompt>
  <adjustedlightsnotification>The brightness of the lights has been adjusted. Areas with multiple light sources may still appear too bright and require reducing the range or brightness of the lights manually. You may also use the console command 'multiplylights' to adjust the brightness of all the lights as once. For example, 'multiplylights 1,1,1,0.5' would decrease the brightness by 50%.</adjustedlightsnotification>
  <noballasttagswarning>You should add the tag 'ballast' to the ballast pumps to allow AI characters to identify which pumps are used for controlling the buoyancy of the submarine.</noballasttagswarning>
  <nohullnameswarning>No names given to any of the hulls, using autogenerated names. Characters use the names to refer to different rooms when reporting things such as hull breaches.</nohullnameswarning>

  <!-- Submarine names & descriptions -->
  <submarine.name.humpback>Humpback</submarine.name.humpback>
  <submarine.description.humpback>A former military vessel, WH4-L3 'Humpback' has been outfitted to withstand most of the dangers in deep Europa. Her relatively high velocity is offset by low maneuverability. As she's still boasting an older model reactor, power needs to be supplemented by a backup battery array or the crew will find themselves unable to run all of the new equipment.</submarine.description.humpback>
  <submarine.name.bunyip>Bunyip</submarine.name.bunyip>
  <submarine.description.bunyip>Latest in the line of personnel transports, Bunyip is capable of ferrying crew between submarines and installations. Its operating radius is considerably lower than its more advanced cousins and no weapons on board makes it vulnerable to attacks.</submarine.description.bunyip>
  <submarine.name.muikku>Muikku</submarine.name.muikku>
  <submarine.description.muikku>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.muikku>
  <submarine.name.orca>Orca</submarine.name.orca>
  <submarine.description.orca>With a relatively high top speed and fantastic ascent and descent characteristics due to her 3 large ballast tanks, Orca class subs are agile vessels, let down only by their small compliment of weapons, unreliable engine and reactors with a greater than average hunger for fuel.</submarine.description.orca>
  <submarine.name.remora>Remora</submarine.name.remora>
  <submarine.description.remora>A range of customization options are available for Remora. In this model, some of the main hull space has been replaced by a detachable ballast and a remote-controlled drone. A large crew is needed to operate this submarine.</submarine.description.remora>
  <submarine.name.typhon>Typhon</submarine.name.typhon>
  <submarine.description.typhon>Typhon class subs are known for their brutish appearance, reasonable array of light and heavy firepower, and their general dependability. Any captain should be aware of their poor rate of descent and unimpressive top speed.</submarine.description.typhon>
  <submarine.name.dugong>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong>
  <submarine.description.dugong>Compared to larger vessels, the Dugong series is overshadowed in all aspects except one: their reliability for their price is world class. They're lacking in firepower and speed, so smart maneuvering is key.</submarine.description.dugong>
  <submarine.name.selkie>Selkie</submarine.name.selkie>
  <submarine.description.selkie>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.selkie>
  <submarine.name.venture>Venture</submarine.name.venture>
  <submarine.description.venture>Originally intended as research vessels, Venture shuttles have been co-opted as a more robust alternative for travel between outposts and submarines.</submarine.description.venture>
  <submarine.name.berilia>Berilia</submarine.name.berilia>
  <submarine.description.berilia>Berilia is top of the line when it comes to mass and firepower. Its two engines and three ballasts require a copious amount of power to operate, and keeping the machinery in condition is a handful for even a moderately large crew.</submarine.description.berilia>

  <tutorial.mechanictitle>Mechanic - Glue, duct tape and your nerve are the only things keeping the crew alive.</tutorial.mechanictitle>
  <tutorial.mechanicdescription>When the plan goes as planned and the gear works is as probable as the human race leaving this shithole. There are no breaks or rest for you, as everything that can break down, will break down. And if nothing’s broken, then it's maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Getting to the next destination is all that matters, and you’re the one who delivers. There’s no thank-yous or respect, just snickering and contempt from your fellow crew members—but that’s okay. This is YOUR survival vessel, and if any of them make it too, well...whoop dee doo for them.</tutorial.mechanicdescription>
  <tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Maintenance of machinery\n-Repairing leaks</tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>
  <tutorial.engineertitle>Engineer - The one who harnesses the power of nature.</tutorial.engineertitle>
  <tutorial.engineerdescription>Power and oxygen, it's like that. Without, the ship don’t move and the lungs won’t breathe. Beyond the fancy talk and costume play, you are the guy who really runs the ship, get it? Trust in the laws of physics and think clear. Also, keep your eye on that damn toy-tinkering wannabe engineer mechanic, and whatever you do, don’t bite into the psycho-babble of the medic. He’s so deep in his softie inner world he’s practically a woman. Captain and security are harmless, and way below your intelligence. Obviously.</tutorial.engineerdescription>

  <tutorial.securityofficertitle>Security Officer - The backbone of violence.</tutorial.securityofficertitle>
  <tutorial.securityofficerdescription>It is said that pressure brings out the worst in people. Not everybody has your moral strength—hell, most of them are so crooked that it’s questionable if they even should be allowed to live. Channel the crew’s anger toward the creatures outside, but never fool yourself into trusting them. Keep the nukes ready, the handcuffs available, and every now and then put someone in the brig just so they know who’s in charge!</tutorial.securityofficerdescription>

  <tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>Guns and engines and reactors don't keep the ship running—people do. It’s up to you to keep the gunner alive to man the guns and captain alive to steer the ship. And remember, your job goes well beyond the physical. We live crammed into tight spaces, under ice, in the sea. When the lights go out and your buddies go to sleep, all kinds of dark shit crawls into their minds. Keep them alive and sane, or put them down like dogs. It’s up to you.</tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>

Hell yeah. This job is at least as much appearing to know what to do as actually knowing what to do. You are the map and the compass, the guy with the big picture. Navigate and make the tough calls. And remember, you’re just a few steps away from being the mayor of an outpost, and if a couple fellows need to die for that—so be it!</tutorial.captaindescription>

  <!-- Tutorial extras -->
  <tutorial.airlocktitle>Airlock</tutorial.airlocktitle>
  <tutorial.airlockdescription>Every submarine should be equipped with a secure airlock where the crew can exit the sub safely and without too much flooding.\n\nTo safely exit the submarine, equip a diving suit and other necessary items (usually a handheld sonar, weapons and extra oxygen tank or two). Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\n\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine. It is also helpful to return all of the equipment back to their proper places and refill used oxygen tanks at the oxygen generator.</tutorial.airlockdescription>
  <tutorial.railguntitle>Railgun</tutorial.railguntitle>
  <tutorial.railgundescription>The railgun works like a coil gun, except it fires big shells that can be upgraded with explosives.\n\nRailgun loaders are loaded with single railgun shells instead of boxes of ammunition. Otherwise, operating them is the same: interact with the periscope to aim with the turret, then press {0} to fire. Press {1} to stop aiming.</tutorial.railgundescription>
  <tutorial.syringeguntitle>Syringe gun</tutorial.syringeguntitle>
  <tutorial.syringegundescription>A ranged weapon of choice for medics, the syringe gun uses medicine as ammunition. This allows for administering cures from afar. Be aware: medicines fired from long range are less effective than those used in the medical interface.\n\nA tactical choice in combat would be to load the syringe gun with poison and fire it at enemies. Aim the syringe gun the same way you would other long-range weapons: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.</tutorial.syringegundescription>
  <tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>Plasma cutter</tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>
  <tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>The plasma cutter is a device used to cut through walls and doors. It functions like the welding tool: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.\n\nWhile the plasma cutter is primarily a tool, it does inflict burns on anyone who gets in the way, which makes it a handy makeshift weapon.</tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>
  <tutorial.crowbartitle>Crowbar</tutorial.crowbartitle>
  <tutorial.crowbardescription>A heavy instrument that can be used to force open doors. Handy when someone has been tampering with door wiring or when you need to get to rooms you’re not allowed in. Use ({0}) the crowbar on a closed door to start prying it open. The crowbar must be equipped to do this.</tutorial.crowbardescription>
  <tutorial.mineralstitle>Minerals</tutorial.mineralstitle>
  <tutorial.mineralsdescription>The basic materials for crafting can be bought, deconstructed or found in the world.\n\nMinerals are spawned in the cave and ice walls, and they can be cut out using the plasma cutter and then picked up. Raw minerals can be deconstructed to create craftable elements.</tutorial.mineralsdescription>
  <tutorial.psychosistitle>Psychosis</tutorial.psychosistitle>
  <tutorial.psychosisdescription>When in contact with certain performance-enhancing drugs or under some extraterrestrial influence, players may be afflicted with psychosis, causing them to experience visual and auditory hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nPsychosis may be cured using haloperidol.</tutorial.psychosisdescription>
  <tutorial.opiatestitle>Opiate addiction and withdrawals</tutorial.opiatestitle>
  <tutorial.opiatesdescription>Overuse of pain medication causes addiction and, in time, withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by feeding the addiction, but to truly be rid of the effects, one must either stop taking the drugs entirely or use naloxone.</tutorial.opiatesdescription>
  <tutorial.oxygentitle>Oxygen</tutorial.oxygentitle>
  <tutorial.oxygendescription>Oxygen is a valuable commodity in underwater Europa. It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>
  <tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>
  <tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}. Use {1} and {2} buttons to climb the ladder. Let go of the ladder by pressing {3} again.</tutorial.ladderdescription>

If you want to take a shot at creating your own custom content with the editors, you may be able to find help through the following links:</editordisclaimertext>

  <!-- goblin traitor mission text package -->
  <goblins_traitormissionstartinfotext>As you hear scratching from below, it occurs to you it's been a while since the ballast goblins have been fed. As luck would have it, there's plenty of meat to go around.</goblins_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>First, some seasonings. A well stocked kitchen has many options but for this purpose, only the purest cyanide will do.\n[traitorgoalinfos]</goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <goblins_objectivesuccessmessage1>Ah yes, this will do nicely.</goblins_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>Let's start the darlings off with some water.\n[traitorgoalinfos]</goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <goblins_objectivesuccessmessage2>There we go.</goblins_objectivesuccessmessage2>
  <goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>Hors d'oeuvres, anyone?\n[traitorgoalinfos]</goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>
  <goblins_objectivesuccessmessage3>Look at that tender, succulent meat!</goblins_objectivesuccessmessage3>
  <goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>Now for the main course: \n[traitorgoalinfos]</goblins_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>
  <goblins_objectivesuccessmessage4>Now the goblins are fed, but the pantry is empty. Time to pick up some more supplies at the next station.</goblins_objectivesuccessmessage4>

  <!-- oxygen_sabotage mission text package -->
  <oxygen_sabotage_traitormissionstartinfotext>Time for another experiment. This time we're testing how the human body reacts to being deprived of oxygen.</oxygen_sabotage_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <oxygen_sabotage_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>Subjects have been gathered and we are ready to start.\n[traitorgoalinfos]</oxygen_sabotage_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <oxygen_sabotage_objectivesuccessmessage1>Subjects should start feeling the effects shortly. Symptoms for oxygen deprivation include, but aren't limited to: extremities turning blue, seizures and fainting.</oxygen_sabotage_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <oxygen_sabotage_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>When you're happy with the data you've gathered, dispose of the test subjects.\n[traitorgoalinfos]</oxygen_sabotage_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <oxygen_sabotage_objectivesuccessmessage2>Another successful test. Report back to nearest coalition outpost.</oxygen_sabotage_objectivesuccessmessage2>

  <!--acidparty traitor mission-->
  <acidparty_traitormissionstartinfotext>You find a manically scribbled note in your pocket. "Hey man. You know there's this thing in the center of the moon, right? What if there was, like, a way to see what it is without physically going in there?"</acidparty_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>"Step 1. Find some delimi- delirun- der- the thing that says 'DEL', right?" \n[traitorgoalinfos]</acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage1>This must be it. Never had this before.</acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>"Step 2. Sometimes subs carry these- these "vision blockers", right? Basically what they do is, is they ground you and then you only see, like, a real narrow representation of reality, ok? So what you wanna do is you wanna get rid of those. They call them shits halleberrydil or some shit like that." \n[traitorgoalinfos]</acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage2>Looks like that's all of it.</acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage2>
  <acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>"Step 3. "First rule is we gotta share. The thing here is that some people, right? Some people are kinda brainwashed into being afraid of anything that challenges their world view, you know? So you know, you gotta find a way to sneak that good shit into their system, right?" \n[traitorgoalinfos]</acidparty_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>
  <acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage3>"Step 4. Lay down and listen to the waves, man."</acidparty_objectivesuccessmessage3>

  <!-- Tainted welding tools traitor mission text package -->
  <tainted_welding_traitormissionstartinfotext>Scanning furtively around, you notice nobody's looking at you — which makes this the perfect time to snap into action.</tainted_welding_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>You've spent months gaining the trust of this crew, and it's all about to pay off:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <tainted_welding_goalinfotext_1>Search the emergency supply cabinets around the sub. One of the diving masks has a small low-frequency receiver hidden in it, which you'll need in order to achieve your objectives.</tainted_welding_goalinfotext_1>
  <tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage1>You find the tiny radio receiver and activate it.</tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>The receiver crackles and whistles as a weak signal is received: Europan Resistance direct action, you are clear to go ahead with the mission: This sub has to be sunk, and it has to look like an accident. Start by sabotaging the welding gear.\n[traitorgoalinfos]</tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <tainted_welding_goalinfotext_2>Swap the welding fuel for oxygen tanks in at least 70% of the sub's welding tools.</tainted_welding_goalinfotext_2>
  <tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage2>Well done. Oxygen tanks tend to burn when loaded in welding tools.</tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage2>
  <tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>Now you'll need to dispose of that commandeered fuel so the crew can't put to use later:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>
  <tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage3>Well done! The crew are in a particularly vulnerable situation now without even knowing it</tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage3>
  <tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>Now quickly, spring the trap!\n[traitorgoalinfos]</tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>
  <tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage4>Fine work, comrade! The pigs are surely doomed now.</tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage4>
  <tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage5>Make your escape! A shuttle will be dispatched shortly to pick you up!\n[traitorgoalinfos]</tainted_welding_traitorobjectivestartmessage5>
  <tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage5>The warning alarm on your diving suit sounds... the shuttle should have rendezvous with you some time ago, but the only movement in the gloom are schools of alien  organisms. You broadcast another transmission: "This is Europan Resistance direct action, come in! Requesting extraction!". The transmitter remains silent, you've been left to your fate. Europa embraces you. </tainted_welding_objectivesuccessmessage5>

  <!-- One of Us traitor mission text package -->
  <one_of_us_traitormissionstartinfotext>A voice within your head screams loudly enough to startle you: THE CULT OF THE HUSK CALLS YOU TO SERVICE!</one_of_us_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>An idea gradually forms in your mind, strangely seductive to you in spite of its mundane nature:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <one_of_us_goalinfotext_1>Search the storage lockers—a special message just for you is hidden under one of the spare oxygen tanks.</one_of_us_goalinfotext_1>
  <one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage1>As you somehow predicted, a slip of filthy paper is stuck to the underside of this oxygen tank. It's covered in primitive scribbles, but you intuitively understand it to be coded instructions.</one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>Your first task:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <one_of_us_goalinfotext_2>Sacred vessels of the husk's young have been hidden behind a loose vent. Find these eggs quickly before another stumbles upon them!</one_of_us_goalinfotext_2> 
  <one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage2>A rush of pleasure hits you like a wave as you find the eggs. A dry, mad laugh echoes within your head for a moment, fading into indistinct wet clicks.</one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage2>
  <one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>You read the next coded instruction:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>
  <one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage3>Your head spins and your vision narrows as the last of the calyxanide is destroyed.</one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage3>
  <one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>Your read the final task:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</one_of_us_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>
  <one_of_us_goalinfotext_4>All on this sub must partake of communion with the husk!</one_of_us_goalinfotext_4>
  <one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage4>With that, there is nothing more to do. The sub is in disarray, the voice in your head grows silent, and your fate is sealed.</one_of_us_objectivesuccessmessage4>
  
  <!-- Easterbunny mission text package -->
  <easterbunny_traitormissionstartinfotext>Praise the Honkmother!</easterbunny_traitormissionstartinfotext>
  <easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>It's time. As the man with the strange painted face instructed you back on the loading dock at Minos Linea, you get to work:\n[traitorgoalinfos]:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage1>
  <easterbunny_goalinfotext_1>Find a very special egg, possibly hidden in one of the vents</easterbunny_goalinfotext_1>
  <easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage1>The egg disgusts you, but fits neatly in your pocket. HONK!</easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage1>
  <easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>Grow the egg:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage2>
  <easterbunny_goalinfotext_2>Find a safe place for the egg to grow, and feed it [catalystitem]</easterbunny_goalinfotext_2>
  <easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage2>The egg bulges and makes strange noises... You're about to become a parent!</easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage2>
  <easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>The egg cracks and a mudraptor bursts forth:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage3>
  <easterbunny_goalinfotext_3>See to it by any means that the mudraptor survives for at least 3 minutes</easterbunny_goalinfotext_3>
  <easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage3>Honk Honk! That was hilarious, the painted man's going to get a kick out of this when he hears how it went.</easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage3>
  <easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>Escape:\n[traitorgoalinfos]</easterbunny_traitorobjectivestartmessage4>
  <easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage4>The lights of a shuttle cut through the gloom. Rescue is at hand! You swear you can almost hear circus music coming from it.</easterbunny_objectivesuccessmessage4>
