v0.18.1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unstable only:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.18.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Balancing:
- Cargo mission reward of construction materials has been reduced to be less balance-breaking.
- Many fabrication and deconstruction recipes changed to prevent infinite construction loops.
- Reduced selling price to ~25% of base price to avoid getting too rich from looting too early/easily
- Increased effect of "Requested Goods" to be 2x to compensate for the decreased selling price.
- Alien artifacts and trinkets can still be sold for a high price at research stations. (2x modifier, to compensate for the reduced selling price)
- Removed batteries from Headset, to reduce the value of selling/deconstructing these.
- Duffelbag deteriorates over time when in use, and now is carried with both hands.
- All items now deconstruct into less materials than it takes to construct them. Avoiding infinite construction/deconstruction loops for easy skill leveling.
- Revisited all item spawns (WIP). Drastically reduced and adjusted the spawns everywhere. Disabled some spawns in campaign. All the subs should now start with a bare minimum in the campaign.
- (Temporarily?) Removed most hand-placed items from the vanilla subs to make balancing and debugging the auto item placement easier.
- Revisited crew corpse spawns. The id cards are no longer manually placed. The cards found from the crew now actually work.

- Made wreck missions a little more common.

Changes and additions:
- Added damage overlays to characters (characters who've taken damage look damaged).

- Optimized character status effects (e.g. health regen and other constant damage reductions).
- Optimized watcher's acid clouds.
- Optimized loading submarines. Reduces loading times especially when there's lots of items in the sub.
- ID cards can now be purchased from outposts. The card gets assigned the appropriate tags for the character doing the purchase.
- Clients need to wait 1 minute if their vote gets rejected before they can start another vote of the same type.
- Increased the priority of explosion particles to make it less likely for them to not appear when the particle limit has been reached.
- Made matriarch genes slowly heal bleeding (not just afflictions of the type "damage") to get it to be more in line with the description.
- Adjusted small water flow sounds: lower max volume, lerp volume according to the water flow (-> small leaks are much more quiet).

- Fixed crashing when a character tries to operate a turret from outside the sub.
- Fixed submarine name being set to a truncated value in the submarine save dialog if the submarine name text at the top of the screen gets truncated, leading to a crash if you try to save the sub with that name.
- Fixed devices whose power consumption is set to 0 not working when not connected to a grid.
- Fixed outpost NPCs choosing the item to spawn for the device they're operating randomly, occasionally causing them to for example load reactors with volatile rods.
- Clients replicate sending chat messages to wifi components in mp. Fixes radio-linked wifi components not receiving the signals client-side.
- Fixed tab menu staying open during loading screens.
- Signal components' and terminals' sprites don't mirror horizontally in mirrored subs (what's a DNA, RO, ROX or XEGER component??).
- Fixed inability to rewire any docking ports in outpost levels, even if the port is not docked with anything (should only apply to the port docked with the outpost).
- Fixed "Ignore This" orders being wiped when loading an existing multiplayer campaign save.

Modding:
- Fixed permanent stats given by talents not getting synced to clients in multiplayer (doesn't affect any vanilla talents).
- Fixed nullref exception when trying to trigger a location type change to a type that doesn't exist (doesn't happen in the vanilla game).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Players who are allowed to manage money in the multiplayer campaign can use money directly from the bank without having to transfer it to their wallet first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.17.10.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes and additions:
- Overhauled colonies: completely new modules, improved layouts, new structures and items, new events.
- Split outposts stores into several different vendors who sell different types of items.
- New store (and sub editor) categories: weapon, medical, diving, and fuel. Reorganized the items into categories.
- Adjusted the amount of colonies in Cold Caverns.
- Added personal wallets. Everyone in the crew now has their personal wallet that they can use to purchase whatever they wish in outposts. The host (or people with campaign management permissions) can distribute a portion of the mission rewards to the crew or transfer money from the shared funds to the players.
- Reworked campaign permissions: removed BuyItems and CampaignStore permissions (no longer needed, since everyone can buy), added ManageMap and ManageHires permissions, ManageCampaign allows gives you all the other campaign-related permissions.
- Items can be purchased from outpost vending machines using the personal wallet.
- Reworked the power distribution logic. Should fix unstability and inconsistencies in power grids involving relays and batteries.
- Adjustments to reactors and supercapacitors to prevent the increased supercapacitor loads from crippling the subs on default recharge rates: slightly increased Humpback reactor output and decreased the default recharge rate of the capacitors, reduced recharge rates in the 3 new subs and set the supercapacitor efficiency to match the rest of the subs.
- Ballast flora improvements: improved damage visuals, branches die when cut from the root, the flora regenerates health at a rate relative to it's size.
- Made text displays and terminals craftable/attachable/detachable.
- Made Concat component's separator field editable mid-round.
- Made Deadeye Carbine fire in bursts.
- Animation adjustment: The head now rotates towards the mouse cursor while aiming or swimming.
- Swim animation adjustment: The body now rotates towards the aim target also when the character is moving, and not only while staying still. Moving while not facing the movement direction results in reduced movement speed.
- Set the bottom hole probability to 0 in Cold Caverns, which reduces the size and the frequency of holes in the level bottom.
- Characters spawn at a spawnpoint appopriate for their job when using the console command "spawn [job] inside".
- Added "low_oxygen" output to oxygen detectors.
- Beacon missions can spawn other types of monsters than just crawlers.

- Boosted the structure damage from the small crawler eggs from 150 to 200.
- Adjusted structure and item damage for coilgun ammunition: piercing 50% less damage, exploding 100% more damage (from explosions), physicorium 50% more damage.
- Don't populate the abyss in difficulty levels 0 to 10 in single mission mode.
- Modified Selkie emergency hatch: can only use it if the shuttle is flooded.
- Reduce the probability for the coilgun to dismember limbs (or break armor).
- Removed submarine download confirmation prompt. All subs that are required to play in a server will be downloaded automatically, which shouldn't be a problem since they're only stored temporarily.
- Buffed ethanol's and tobacco's effects.
- Renamed "details" to "manage" and "permissions" to "rank" in the client management context menu to make them a little more clear.
- Changes to character aiming behavior.

Modding:
- An extensive rewrite of how the game handles content packages and loading content. Addresses a ton of issues, inconsistencies and usability issues regarding modding.
- The Mods folder has been replaced by folders called "WorkshopMods" and "LocalMods". "WorkshopMods" is used to store mods installed from the Workshop, and any mods stored in it should never need to be modified manually. "LocalMods" is used for developing mods: installing/updating mods never modifies the contents of this folder to prevent any work from being lost.
- Submarines are no longer saved in the Submarines folder, because it made it easy to get vanilla and custom subs mixed up. The sub editor now automatically creates a new local mod for each saved submarine.
- Remade the Workshop menu and made it a tab of the settings menu.
- More robust handling of mod load order, overrides and variants. 
- Clients now download the mods a server is using directly from the server, fixing content mismatches when for example trying to join a server that uses outdated mods.
- Mods now have version numbers to make it easier to determine which of the players are out of date.
- The Workshop preview images are no longer saved into the game folder, fixing the folder gradually growing in size as you use browse mods in the Workshop menu.
- Switching languages no longer requires restarting the game.
- Music can be overridden by identifiers.
- Reimplemented ServerExecutable to be usable in non-core packages. Now, players must select a server executable from a dropdown in the "Host server" menu if multiple are available.
- Character gender and ethnicity are no longer hard-coded: modders can use any kind of arbitrary tags to categorize character sprites.- Option to set the condition of an item spawned with status effects.
- Added new "accessiblebyowner" property to inventories. Allows making a character able to access their inventory even when "accessiblewhenalive" is false.
- Fixed clients not gaining control of the final stage of a husk affliction when "controlhusk" is enabled.
- When using a mod that doesn't set the InitialCount of any job, choose the first 3 jobs as the starting crew. Otherwise the crew customization menu will be empty and starting the campaign will lead to an immediate game over.
- Made it possible for attack StatusEffects to target the character doing the attack instead of the limb by using "Parent" as the target type.
- Using RemoveCharacter on a limb removes the character that limb belongs to.
- Fixed editing human character in the character editor sometimes making the inventory inaccessible.
- Fixed character editor crashing when trying to copy a character (unstable only).
- ItemContainers apply the OnContaining effects even when the item is broken. Doesn't affect any vanilla items.
- Ropes attached to limbs now automatically snap when another attack is chosen.
- Ropes can now be set to break from the end instead of always breaking from the middle (see the new abyss monster for an example).
- Ropes can be set to break if they are in too steep angle to the target.
- Projectiles always stick permanently unless a stick duration is defined.
- Characters (with deformable sprites) can be set to be drawn after (on top of) other characters. Normally characters are drawn in the order of spawning.
- AI Triggers can now be permanent.
- Added a generic damage threshold that currently defines how much damage the character needs to take from a single hit to hit the avoiding and releasing captured targets.
- Added a support for multiple identifiers and types in the limb health definitions.

- Fixed monsters not being able to shoot faster than every ~1.5 second if they change the attacking limb.
- Added new after attack behaviors: Reverse and ReverseUntilCanAttack.
- Fixed "targetcontaineditem" still not working correctly.
- Fixed crashing when trying to remove fog of war at the very edges of the campaign map. Doesn't affect the vanilla game because there's enough padding at the edges of the map.
- Made DockingPort.ApplyEffectsOnDocking editable in the sub editor.
- Option to make missions force a ruin in the level if there isn't one.
- Character editor: don't check the validity of the texture path when copying humans (because the path is not valid and will be parsed later). Allows creating custom human characters by copying the vanilla human (even though they are not fully supported).
- Level editor no longer attempts to save the vanilla content.

Monsters:
- Added Latcher, a new abyss monster.
- Added a difficulty hierarchy for the abyss monsters. Easier monsters should spawn more frequently on an easier difficulty level, the harder should spawn more frequently on higher difficulty levels. Currently the new abyss monster is defined as the easiest, and Endworm the hardest. Charybdis is in between.
- Revisited endworm: the armor now breaks less easily, reduced the change of cutting the worm towards the head, adjusted the bleeding speed.
- Adjusted abyss resource spawning: less resources per level, the number of resources is relative to the difficulty, the spawned resources aren't guaranteed to always be the 5 least common alien materials.
- Made molochs, abyss monsters and fractal guardians immune to poisons.
- Fixed monsters sometimes trying to follow targets after losing the track of them even when they should be falling back from them (according to the after attack behavior).
- Fixed monsters sometimes using the after attack behavior of the current attack even when the cooldown of that attack is not active.
- Fixed monsters sometimes being unable to target the submarine, because their attack was incorrectly considered invalid.
- Fixed fractal guardians fleeing to a shelter immediatedly after taking some damage when they have targeted the guardian pod once and have not changed the target yet (e.g. if you shoot a guardian that is returning from the pod and if it has not yet spotted you).

- Rebalanced mudraptors: slightly more health, less damage at head.
- Crawler: adjusted the vitality multipliers of hands and tail from 50% to 75%.
- Fixed Giant Spineling targeting doors after being attacked, which it shouldn't do by design. Might affect other creatures too.
- Fixed calyxanide not damaging the "naturally spawning" husks.
- Giant Spineling doesn't flee anymore when being shot with coilgun, chaingun, or small arms.
- Adjusted the kill hammerhead missions.

Balance:
- Increased the price of calyxanide to make it more in line with the price of husk eggs.
- Fixed wrecked supply cabinets being treated as normal supply cabinets. Reduces the amount of loot spawned in them.
- Adjust the medical item spawns in wreck and abandoned  med cabinets: less powerful medicines. Basic ingredients and consumables are more common, but come in low quantities.
- Increased the amount of scrap in wrecks.
- Increased Gene Splicer's price from 200 to 500.
- Increase the commonness of Esperite and Galena, which are sources of lead.

- Fixed bots still sometimes getting stuck when trying to get something from or put something to secure lockers.
- Fixed bots acting weird while trying to use underwater scooters inside.
- Fixed bots failing to heal characters in a docked sub/shuttle.

- Made bot healing dialog reflect if CPR was performed or not.
- Fixed security from the player's own crew attacking the player in multiplayer when the player attacks someone in an outpost.

- Fixed "Curiosity" talent not giving experience to allies.
- Removing or changing order priority doesn't trigger the "Commander" talent buff.
- Fixed "Mass Production" talent allowing you to power devices by tinkering.

Now it's unlocked if you get to 500 m above the crush depth or to the end of the level.
- Fixed certain achievements (last man standing, lone sailor, finishing a round with a specific job) not unlocking if you're in a docked sub instead of the main sub at the end of the round.

- Fixed item assemblies getting misaligned with the grid after saving.
- Fixed "Shell A 18" not aligning with the other shell pieces.
- Fixed welding tool's, plasma cutter's and watering can's particle effects getting "clamped" to the edges of the hull they're inside.
- Fixed permission icon in the client list not updating mid-round.
- Fixed "lock default wires" server setting not affecting docked subs.
- Fixed Dugong's small pumps working without power.
- Fixed buttons in structure editing menu using a different style than other types of entities in the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed excessive loading times when playing in Chinese, Japanese or Korean.
- Fixed certain logic components (and/or/xor with an empty output and non-empty false output) stopping to work altogether when they stop sending a signal.
- Fixes to crashes when trying to interact with certain elements in the server lobby while getting disconnected.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.16.6.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed door lights appearing to be off in the tutorials.
- Fixed crashing when you try to use the hotkeys or double-clicking to put an item inside another item you're holding in your left hand, but there's an item with no inventory in your right hand. 
- Fixed inability to repair research stations.
- Fixed status monitors crashing the game if the selected UI style doesn't define "IconOverflowIndicator".
- Fixed crashing when trying to view the specs window of a sub that hasn't been saved yet (= if you create a new sub, go to the test mode and open the submarine tab in the tab menu).
- Fixed some of Spineling's spikes getting hidden for 30 seconds instead of 15.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.16.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes and additions:
- Added a medical clinic to outposts that allows you to heal your crew for a price.
- Added three new sub: Barsuk, Herja and Winterhalter.
- Improvements and polish to the human sprites.
- Improvements and polish to clothing and headgear sprites.
- Added the Submarine tab to the multiplayer campaign store to allow selling items on the submarine.

- Entities can be grouped together and the groups selectively hidden in the submarine editor.
- Balanced mission rewards, commonness and difficulties.
- Added some new decorative items and structures.
- Adjusted medical items' effects on bleeding and burns. Bandages, plastiseal and antibiotic glue are now much more effective at treating them, and morphine & fentanyl only heal them by a negligible amount.
- Heavily increased supercapacitor's power consumption and made the recharge speed increase exponentially when the recharge rate is increased.
- Optimizations to signal logic, status effects and property conditionals.
- Item update optimizations.
- Optimizations to gap logic.
- Optimized multiplayer store interface.
- Added "separator" property to Concat Component.
- Added "power_value_out" and "load_value_out" connections to junction boxes.
- Added "set_output" connection to Greater Than Component, Equals Component and Regex Component.
- Made alien materials spawn in abyss islands.
- Exposed wall healths in the sub editor.
- Modified Orca 2 and R-29 reactor values so they're more in line with other subs.
- Made ballast flora toxins more visible and made them emit a sound.
- Made impacts toss items around less effectively, especially when the item is heavy.
- "Allow rewiring" server setting doesn't affect wrecks, pirate subs or ruins.
- Added an option to disable all in-game hints to the hint message box.
- Option to make sonar displays center on the connected sonar transducer.
- Made the sizes of signal components consistent (32x32px, they also align to the grid now).
- Don't allow fabricators to take items from linked containers the user doesn't have access to.
- Connected diving suit lockers to oxygen in vanilla subs.
- Pulse laser ammo can be bought from outposts and cities.
- Chaingun tweaks: doubled turning speed when firing, reduced charging up time, reduced ammo consumption and made the ammo boxes more expensive.
- Simplified Remora drone docking system.
- Show notifications about reputation changes mid-round.
- Escorted NPCs drop the items they took from the sub (like suits) at the end of the round.
- Added warnings when the game fails to run the physics at the desired 60 updates per second (which would cause rubberbanding in multiplayer). The warnings are shown below the FPS when the client is running slowly, and in the debug console of the host/moderators/admins when the server is.
- Made turret icons on the minimap gray instead of red when not manned (easy to think there's something wrong with the turret when it's red).
- Abandoned outpost's oxygen generators now consume power.
- Made characters crouch a little lower (enough to make it possible to shoot while standing behind a crouching character).
- Added a "sendchatmessage" console command with an option to configure the color of the message.
- Added button to align selected items and wire nodes to grid to the sub editor.
- Allow using cheats in editors.

- Allow wiring non-interactable items and accessing non-interactable containers in the sub editor.
- Chaingun projectiles and canister shells cause lacerations instead of gunshot wounds.
- Added recycle recipe to SMG magazines.
- Significantly reduced the speed at which welding tools fix walls.
- Changed the small arms max stack sizes to either 6 or 12 when the clip size is 6. Makes it less tedious to use the extra ammunition.
- Added damage sounds to doors when they take 10 or more damage.
- Made outpost containers' sprite depths more consistent with other containers.
- Added tags to outpost medical compartments and made them linkable.
- Mission completion and failure icons are now displayed mid-round in the tab menu.

Monsters:
- Added 3 new monster variants: Giant Spineling, Crawler Broodmother and Veteran Mudraptor.
- An overall balance and behavior fix pass on all monsters. Feedback is welcome.
- Monster mission reward and difficulty level adjustments.
- Adjustments to the random monster spawn events.
- Adjusted the loot dropped by Crawler Broodmother, Giant Spineling, and Bonethresher.
- Moloch Pupa and Hammerhead Matriarch now also drop some loot.
- Crawler Eggs now deconstruct into suplhuric acid (and adrenaline gland, if they are not the smallest variants).
- Fixed mudraptors being unable to hit the targets that are very near.
- Fixed monsters sometimes getting stuck near the Humpback's bottom railgun.
- Fixed monsters getting stuck on trying to reach open gaps that are on the other side of the sub.
- Fixed aggressive boarders not being aggressive enough inside the player sub, because they couldn't target things that were blocked by a wall.
- Fixed Molochs not doing anything when there's babies around.
- Fixed Mudraptors not staying together in swarms.
- Fixed monsters continuing to eat a characters who've been revived with console commands (leading to weird results, such as the character being able to run around after being dismembered)..
- Fixed some monsters, like crawlers, trying to target walls with lots of gaps even though there are better targets closer to them.
- Fixed monsters being unable to target inner walls when they are technically outside of the sub (= when there's no hull where they are). Such places, between the outer and the inner walls, can be found e.g. in Humpback.
- Tigerthreshers can now target doors.
- Monsters that try to get inside the sub, should now notice and priorize doors more overall. Affects e.g. Mudraptors, and to lesser extent Crawlers (and Tigerthreshers).
- Monsters' burns don't heal by themselves.
- Fixed hammerhead matriarchs sometimes spawning in low-difficulty levels.
- Fixed endworm not having a burn damage modifier in the right tooth.
- Changed Golden Hammerhead's behavior towards stronger monsters.

AI:
- The order of the crew list is saved between rounds in single player.
- Indicate when a bot is following someone else than you on the crew list's order icons.
- When quick-assigning orders, prioritize the characters with the same Operate order only when they are targeting the same item.
- When quick-assigning orders, don't prioritize characters with the same Maintenance order. Otherwise, Maintenance orders will always be quick-assigned to characters who already have the samer order. This will prevent giving out multiple Maintenance orders of the same type to multiple characters using the quick-assignment logic.
- Allow quick-assigning the same kind of Operate order to multiple characters. Previously, it would always be given to the character that already had the same kind of order.
- Added a new "Assault Enemy" order: bots with the order will seek out and attack any hostile characters in any connected submarines or outposts.
- Made the order quick-assigning logic prefer characters who don't have the order yet (among the characters with the appropriate job).
- Made it possible to use the order quick-assignment to give the Fix Leaks order to all character (although mechanics, engineers, and assistants are still preferred).
- Fixed bots sometimes getting stuck while trying to fix a leak that's not in the same sub (e.g. bot in Remora and the leak in the drone).
- Reduced the range where the bots can spot enemies outside of the sub.
- Improved bots' ability to return back to the submarine from caves.
- Fixed oxygen shards from old saves still being used as oxygen sources by bots.
- Fixed bots getting stuck in certain spots with ladders (e.g. Berilia's reactor room).
- Fixed contextual "clean up" order not being visible for weapons.
- Defined preferred containers for some items and added "locker" as the secondary preferred container for most items. Helps bots clean up things even when they can't find the primary container for the items.
- Fixed bots sometimes halting briefly next to a door when they shouldn't.
- "Fight intruders" order doesn't make the bots enter abandoned outposts to fight the enemies there.
- Disable aggressive behavior towards the player for the friendly crew members in single player (= accidental friendly fire never turns the security hostile in single player).
- Fixed bots saying they can't find items to load when someone takes an item they were targeting.
- Fixed bots saying they can't reach a leak when someone else fixes it before them.
- Fixed bots sometimes trying to adjust auto-controlled pumps when doing the autonomous Pump Water objective.
- Arrested pirate captains don't try to give orders to their crew.
- Change how captains (and theoretically other bots with an autonomous fight intruders order) behave: instead of idling around, they'll flee to the safety. And if there's no security officers around, they should fight the enemy aggressively.
- Fixed bots filling target containers with items that can't be refilled/recharged when given the Load Items order (e.g. putting welding fuel tanks in oxygen tank shelves).
- Made bots prefer the same fuel rods or ammo as already loaded when they're operating a reactor or a turret and need to find new ones.
- Bots that follow a character who's going inside/outside stick closer to the character they're following. Helps the bots to get back inside with you.
- Fixed pets becoming hostile towards the crew and other pets if a human attacks the character they're protecting.
- Fixed pirates not operating turrets when they have no power. 
- Fixed bots not unequipping diving suits when they have an order but not actively following it (i.e. they are on idle).
- Fixed Operate orders not being dismissed automatically when another character is ordered to operate the same device.
- Fixed the dialogue reserved for rearranging character orders not being used in multiplayer.
- Fixed bots sometimes getting stuck on ladders while swimming.
- Fixed bots returning to the sub even when they have an active wait order. Happened when the order was given inside and then when e.g. the character is controlled by the player, and then when the player changes the character, the bot falls to the "find safety objective", because it's not allowed to stay outside.
- Bots can find buttons connected to a door using links made in the sub editor. Allows working around complex circuits that prevent the bots from figuring out which button controls a door.
- Fixed bots taking battery cells from portable pumps without considering their condition when acting on the Recharge Battery Cells order.
- Fixed bots not always reacting to monsters when they should be able to see them, while swimming outside.
- Fixed bots accidentally damaging friendly characters while trying to hit Swarmfeeders latched on to them.
- Fixed bots not using melee weapons when there's Swarmfeeders latched on to them.
- Fixed bots being able to shoot without any delay if they already have a weapon equipped.
- Fixed bots dropping the syringe inside PUCS when replacing the oxygen tank.
- Fixed bots sometimes failing to find a path to a docked shuttle or drone.
- Fixed NPCs reacting to combat between other characters when they shouldn't (e.g. when they don't witness it).
- Fixed bots not re-equipping body armor/ballistic helmet/something else when they drop the diving gear.
- Fixed bots having issues with some stairs. Note: these changes might require alterations on stair waypoints. Currently the generator doesn't do perfect job there. Look for the examples on how to fix them manually in the vanilla subs.
- Fixed bots sometimes trying to put items they're cleaning up into containers inside fabricators/deconstructors (e.g. an oxygen tank into a diving suit in a fabricator).
- Fixed bots equipping gene splicers when cleaning them up, causing the genetic material to get destroyed when the bot puts the splicer in a container.

Talents:
- Removed the special stat boosts from "Olympian" (now it only increases the skill cap to 200).
- Halved the amount of damage "Still Kicking" heals (100 -> 50)
- Reduced gunshot wounds inflicted by handcannon.
- "True Potential" only has a chance of instakilling things smaller than a moloch.
- Halved damage buff from "Quickdraw" (80% -> 40%).
- Reduced skill gain from "Field Medic" (7 -> 3).
- Nerfed "Warlord" (20% chance of doubling the damage -> 5% chance).
- Reduced damage buff from "Expert Commando" (40% -> 20%).
- Health scanner doesn't show buffs from talents.
- Fixed "unused talent points" indicator staying visible after all talents have been unlocked if the character's gained extra talent points from other talents.
- Fixed incorrect talents sometimes unlocking server-side when unlocking "All-Seeing Eye". Happened because the server checked how many talents the client can unlock before applying All-Seeing Eye, which meant that the 3 extra talents would not be available, and the server would leave the last 3 talents unlocked.
- Fixed "Inspired to Act" talent only giving a skill bonus of 9.98 instead of 10.
- Fixed "Atmos Machine" talent not spawning psychosis artifacts or alien pistols.
- Fixed "Hazardous Materials" considering any reactor outside the main sub (e.g. beacon station) a wreck reactor.
- Fixed ranged weapons (including turrets) triggering "Electrochemist" talent's stun.

Bugfixes:
- Fixes character resetting in MP campaign if you join mid-round and don't get to spawn in before the next round in a campaign you've previously played in.
- Fixed equipping two of the same genetic material and then unequipping one of them removing all the genetic effects.
- Fixed "novice seafarer", "experienced seafarer" and "naval architect" achievements being possible to unlock even if cheats are enabled.
- Fixed kills in multiplayer sessions not progressing the "xenocide" and "genocide" achievements, and kills being reported to Steam unreliably.
- Fixed clients not spawning the respawn shuttle if they join after the server had disabled the shuttle mid-round, leading to an "entity not found" kick.
- Fixed medical effects being different when the medical item is fired with a syringe gun.
- Fixed wall healths being half of what they should be on vanilla subs, increased structure damages to compensate.
- Fixed fabricator sometimes desyncing in MP when some of the ingredients are in the user's inventory.
- Fixed clients trying to reconnect to SteamP2P indefinitely if establishing the initial connection fails, eventually leading to a crash.
- Fixed "allow linking wifi to chat" server setting causing syncing problems with headsets. The setting wasn't synced with clients who don't have settings management permissions, which would cause them to get some of the wifi components' properties mixed up and sometimes prevent them from communicating using the headsets.
- Fixed motion detector requiring the target's velocity to be higher than the specified minimum velocity, instead of higher than or equal. As a result, a minimum velocity of 0 would not sometimes detect targets in range.
- Fixed an exploit that allowed combining genetic materials in deconstructors.
- Fixed "fixitems" command setting genetic materials' condition to 100.
- Fixed "reset to prefab" not resetting wall healths.
- Fixed certain logic components not passing forwards the character who sent the signal, preventing e.g. the character who undocked a drone from being logged or the character who killed something from being determined if the signal activates a weapon.
- Orca 2: Fixed missing power wires to a couple small pumps, neutral ballast level, gunnery marked as wet room. Added a duct block between upper and lower deck. Some minor visual fixes.
- Fixed voronoi sites sometimes getting placed outside the level's bounds, leading to messed up level geometry.
- Fixed turrets always starting at rotation 0 at the beginning of the round (instead of halfway between the min/max angles like in the editor).
- Fixed changing a delay component's delay using the editing hud not having an effect in-game when the component is receiving a continuous signal.
- Take structures/items with a collider into account when calculating a sub's dimensions (as opposed to just hulls). Fixes dimensions being incorrect in the submarine's info if the sub includes structures that extend far outside the hulls.
- Fixed crashing when swimming up from hull to another in a specific kind of hull configuration (two hulls side-by-side, with a gap leading up to another one).
- Fixed oxygen shards from old saves still being used as oxygen sources by bots.
- Fixed changes not being applied to all selected items when multi-editing a string field in the sub editor and deselecting the items without applying the changes by pressing enter.
- The game doesn't try to save a campaign if an exception occurs at any point during the saving process (should fix rare occurrences of campaign saves getting corrupted).
- Don't allow signals to deactivate ItemContainers. Fixes portable pumps' "toggle" input not working.
- Fixed removed items staying visible on the status monitor's electrical tab.
- Fixed plants still using the old values in old saves (i.e. dying too fast when not watered).
- Outposts can't request the "psychosisartifact_event" item (an event-specific special artifact that looks identical to the normal ones).
- Fixed size of a door's gap relative to the door changing when rescaling the door in the sub editor.
- Fixed fabricator consuming all the suitable ingredients when the ingredient is configured using a tag instead of an identifier (e.g. fabricating a stun gun dart would consume all the wires in the input slots).
- Fixed motion detector's detect offset getting mirrored when copying a mirrored detector.
- Fixed status monitor's submarine blueprint refreshing when initiating docking with a shuttle, instead of when the docking ports lock (sometimes causing the shuttle to appear slightly off from the docking port on the monito).
- Fixed fabricator failing to stack oxygenite tanks.
- Fixed items in the player's inventory not getting highlighted as valid ingredients when using a fabricator.
- Attempt to fix a rare crash caused by ScalableFont.DrawStringWithColors.
- Fixed freezing when trying to enable GameAnalytics from the settings menu on Mac.
- Fixed locked connection panel and non-interactable lights in R-29.
- Fixed Delay Component failing to parse set_delay inputs on systems that use comma as the decimal separator.
- Fixed charge rate not being displayed correctly on batteries in Chinese.
- Fixed junction box load not being displayed on status monitors in Russian.
- Fixed oxygen tanks being misaligned in oxygen generators.
- Fixed motion sensor not being able to detect subs in the sub editor test mode.
- Fixed recycled volatile fulgurium rods incorrectly using mechanical instead of electrical skill.
- Consider the character who severed a limb as the character who inflicted the afflictions caused by severing the limb. + Consider the character who caused bleeding as the character who caused the resulting bloodloss. Fixes achievements not unlocking and talents not triggering if you kill a target by cutting its limbs off or by making it bleed to death.
- Fixed characters sometimes becoming momentarily unresponsive when swimming out from a hull.
- Fixed speed penalty caused by the vegetation in caves sometimes not disappearing after passing through the vegetation.
- Fixed links from a docking port to a linked sub not being considered valid in the sub editor (only a link from linked sub to a docking port). Now the order of the link doesn't matter.
- Fixed repair window showing up if you use a periscope wired to a broken device.
- Fixed sonar getting misaligned when switching to the docking mode (the amount of misalignment being relative to the distance of the docking port from the sub's center).
- Fixed light textures not rotating with the lamps in the sub editor.
- Fixed elements in CustomInterface getting misaligned if the signal_out connections aren't used in sequential order (e.g. if you only connect a wire to outputs 2 and 3).
- Fixed server including lines multiple times in the saved server logs (e.g. the 2nd saved log file would include some lines that were already saved to the 1st log file).
- Fixed initial husk infection message being displayed immediately after getting infected, not after the infection advances.
- Fixed equip slots being misplaced if you open the health interface when the equip slots have been hidden.
- Fixed wrecks sometimes not spawning in levels despite a wreck mission being selected.
- Fixed characters moving slowly downwards when aiming underwater.
- Fixed moloch shell shields not protecting the user from non-hitscan weapons or melee weapons.
- Fixed messed up mining crane sprite.
- Fixed crashing when pirates try to operate the sub using a nav terminal that doesn't control any sub (doesn't affect vanilla subs because they don't contain that kind of nav terminals).
- Fixed fabricator showing the info of the selected item wrong when selecting the fabricator with another character (e.g. fabrication time still calculated based on the previous user's skills).
- Fixed characters reading skillbooks upside-down.
- Fixed personality traits changing after every round in mp campaign.
- Fixed monsters always eating the character they're grabbing, even when the monster is configured as not being able to eat (in practice only happened when a player controlled something like a fractal guardian and grabbed another character).
- Fixed characters sometimes using the "priorities have changed" dialogue when giving a new order.
- Fixed pumps' auto-controlled status not being updated correctly.
- Added some extra logging to diagnose the "did not receive STARTGAMEFINALIZE message from the server" errors.
- Misc localization fixes and improvements.
- Fixed tab menu's character tab not refreshing when switching to another character.
- Fixed ballast flora still being present when you replace an infested lost shuttle in an outpost.
- Fixed occasional crashes and entity ID errors when entering a new level with a ballast flora infested sub.
- Fixed inability to swap SMG magazines (or other items that go inside the held item) by double-clicking.
- Fixed "failed to parse the string to Vector2" when loading bot orders that have been saved on a system that uses comma as a decimal separator.
- Fixed rounding error in RespawnManager that caused it to require 1 extra dead player to trigger a respawn (e.g. 9 players and a minimum of 30% players to respawn required 3 players, but the client-side texts showed 2).
- Fixed "stairs left" appearing mirrored in the status monitor's sub blueprint and in the sub editor's entity selection menu.
- Fixed Wifi Component's "set_channel" input not working when sending signals to it via chat in multiplayer.
- Fixed autoshotgun not taking stacks into account in the ammo indicator below the inventory slot (= displaying it as being full when there's one shell in each slot, even though more could be stacked on the slots).
- Fixed hitscan turrets sometimes hitting targets inside your own sub when there's linked subs present.
- Fixed faraday and nasonov artifacts' periodic explosions stopping if the round is ended during their 0.5s "reset" period.
- Fixed oxygenite shards not exploding in depth charge shells.
- Fixed killer sometimes being determined incorrectly when a character gets killed by something else than another character: e.g. if a character got crushed by pressure, the character who last did damage to them was considered to be the killer, which could for example lead to achievements being unlocked in inappropriate situations.
- Fixed pumps not taking the volumes/shapes of the linked hulls into account when using "set_targetlevel", causing the neural level to be off in irregularly shaped multi-hull ballasts.
- Fixed artifacts sometimes spawning outside the level when there's no artifact holder to place them in (e.g. when having 2 artifact missions active at the same time).
- The electrical grid in beacon stations is turned indestructible after activating it. Should fix beacon missions sometimes failing for no apparent reason (if something happened to damage the beacon's walls during the round and flood it).
- Attempt to fix a null reference exception in Map.RemoveFogOfWar (suspecting it was caused by a mod that didn't configure the campaign map's sprite for some biome).
- Fixed nav terminal's docking button staying visible if the terminal is disconnected from the docking port by deactivating a relay between them.
- Fixed cursor position jittering when the sub is moving fast.
- Fixed discharge coils in Berilia and Orca 2 being connected to junction boxes instead of supercapacitors.
- Fixed wall colliders generating twice on abyss islands without caves, and the 1st generated wall not getting mirrored along with the level, leading to "invisible walls" in some areas of the abyss in mirrored levels.
- Pirates that are outside or unconscious count as being dead in the pirate missions. Fixes pirate missions failing if e.g. one of the pirates gets stranded outside their sub.
- Fixed some turrets being possible to power with batteries, even though the maximum power output of the batteries shouldn't be high enough.
- Fixed the drug dealer in the "heart of gold" event fleeing from the other bandits.
- Fixed decapitating not working as it should.
- Fixed being able to grab hostile NPCs.
- Fixed sound effects not playing when a monster hits the sub's inner wall.
- Fixed correct sprite not being used in the great sea on the campaign map.
- Fixed "settings" text overlapping in the settings menu when using a very large text size.
- EventManager doesn't consider monsters in a docked non-player sub (e.g. abandoned outpost) to be "inside the sub". Fixes intensity always being at 100% in monster-infested outposts.
- Fixed outpost cabinet's sprite having empty space above it.
- Fixed inability to put syringe guns, toy hammers, welding tools, plasma cutters and sprayers in weapon holders.
- Fixed escort missions giving huge rewards in higher difficulty levels.
- Fixed a nullref exception in CharacterHUD.Draw when an icon can't be found for a campaign interaction.

Modding:
- Added "HealCostMultiplier" attribute to AfflictionPrefabs that adjusts the heal cost in medical clinic.
- EntitySpawnerComponent treats positive y offset as up to make it more consistent with other components.
- Added an option to define a hard limit for how many entities EntitySpawnerComponent can spawn.
- Fixed "targetself" attack conditionals checking both the attacker and the target.
- Added "delaybetweenspawns" property to MonsterEvents (determines the delay between spawning the individual monsters of a given monster event).
- Don't allow setting an item's or limb's density to 0 (leads to "attempted to apply invalid force/torque" errors).
- Fixed shields blocking projectiles from the user's weapon. Didn't affect any vanilla items, because all the shields are 2-hand items that prevent using a weapon at the same time.
- Fixed ButtonTerminals without an ItemContainer component causing crashes.
- If a mod makes a vanilla item movable/detachable and sets it as being attached by default, attach it to a wall when loading a sub that already had those items placed. I.e. making static devices movable doesn't cause them to deattach in existing subs.
- Fixed monster AI's targeting priorities doing nothing if the threshold is 0 and the target hasn't done any damage.
- Fixed custom ID card tags not working in wrecks.
- Fixed Rope component not attaching to the limb it's fired from in multiplayer (doesn't affect any vanilla content).
- Fixed crashing in multiplayer when there are spectators in the server and someone reaches the final stage of a modded husk affliction that allows remaining in control of the final form.
- Fixed wearables that are equipped into multiple slots (e.g. InnerClothes+OuterClothes) not being visible when worn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.23.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed inability to switch subs in multiplayer campaign, unless you opt to switch at the same time as you purchase the new sub.
- Fixed server not loading the previous save, but continuing from where you left off if you return to the server lobby without saving and try to continue.
- Fixed characters who've died and respawned during a round getting a penalty to their skills again on the following round.
- Attempt to fix clients sometimes gaining control of an incorrect character in the multiplayer campaign.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.22.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed GameAnalytics consent prompt still going outside the window on small resolutions and/or large text sizes.
- Fixed deconstructor not being able to put the items into containers in the output slots.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.22.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing on startup on some versions of macOS.
- Fixed Kastrull's drone sometimes spawning inside the sub client-side in multiplayer.
- Fixed opening the settings menu resetting the game window, which caused screen capture software to stop capturing the window.
- Fixed certain mods that don't configure the "you are here" circle sprite for the status monitors causing crashes.
- Fixed abilities that give simultaneous skill gain (minor in mechanics, once upon a time in europa, apprenticeship) not giving the extra skill points.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.21.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed "allow linking wifi to chat" server setting preventing clients without the permission to manage server settings from using their headsets.
- Fixed repair minigame not working correclty if the user has a talent that allows repairing past max condition.
- Fixed "error in Order Pump Water - the number of option names doesn't match the number of options" errors in Russian, Korean and Traditional Chinese.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.20.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- New submarine: Orca 2.
- Improved monster spawning: different monsters spawn in different biomes and tougher monsters are introduced gradually during the course of the campaign. WIP, probably requires balancing and adjusting. Feedback is welcome.
- Adjusted gardening: the plants now require less continuous attention, making gardening a more viable "downtime activity" that you can focus on when there's nothing else to do, and ignore when you're busy without killing the plants.
- Readded GameAnalytics, a library that allows us to collect gameplay statistics and error reports automatically. Sending statistics is completely optional: when you launch the game, you're asked whether you want to allow the game to send us data or not. If you decline, no data of any kind is collected. The collected data is completely anonymous and doesn't contain any personal information, but only things such as error reports and statistics about the selected game mode, submarine, missions and mods.
- Added a simple QTE "minigame" to the repair interface. Allows speeding up the repairs slightly and hopefully makes repairing feel a little more engaging.
- Characters can climb up ladders faster by holding the sprint key.
- Changed the way purchasable submarines for the multiplayer campaign are selected: instead of choosing them when creating the campaign, all of the server's visible submarines are made available for purchase.
- Diving suits play a different warning sound when low on oxygen (<5% left in tank).
- PUCS doesn't consume oxygen tanks in rooms with oxygen.
- Added "Pump In" option to the contextual "Pump Water" order.
- Added "fuel_percentage_left" output to reactors. Outputs the sum of the fuel rods' condition percentage, as opposed to the total "heating power" of the rods like the "fuel_out" output.
- Powered down reactors don't zap the user when repairing.
- Improved weapon indicators on the status monitor (they now indicate the rotation of the turrets).
- Damaging outpost NPCs when there's a monster or an instigator nearby doesn't turn the outpost NPCs hostile (i.e. accidentally damaging one of the NPCs when you're fighting a hostile NPC doesn't trigger the guards).
- Damaging outpost NPCs when there's a monster or an instigator nearby doesn't lower outpost reputation.
- Adjustments to job gear and diving suit sprites and inventory icons.
- New depth charge tube sprite.
- Added a verification prompt when saving and quitting a campaign round (mp or sp).
- Added options to adjust karma penalty for containing dangerous items in the server settings.
- Made it a bit more viable to take out enemy humans stealthily: if an attack immediately kills/incapacitates the character, others won't be alerted unless they witness the attack.
- Option to end outpost rounds without saving.
- Made sonar transducer consume less power when the sonar is running in passive mode (or when the transducer isn't connected to anything).
- Treatment suggestions in the health interface take items in subinventories into account as well.

- Connected the diving suit lockers on the vanilla submarines to the power grid so that they refill the contained oxygen tanks.
- Connected the oxygen shelves on Humpback to the power grid.
- Allowed in-game editing of lamps in R-29.
- Mudraptor shell shields block projectiles and can be destroyed by firing at them.
- Prototype Steam Cannon can damage ballast flora.
- Water detectors treat minuscule amounts (< 1.0 water volume) as 0.

- Medical curtains can be opened and closed.
- Restricted the amount of additional cargo you can choose in multiplayer: max 10 items of a type, max 20 types of items.
- Allow editing item quality in the sub editor.

- Shotguns now spawn with 6 shells, autoshotguns with 8 (a full stack).

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed campaign character resetting if the client, disconnects, rejoins and respawns on the same round after their character has gotten killed.
- Fixed skill penalties not getting applied when respawning during the same round.
- Fixed several issues (namely mission/submarine mismatches and desyncs) when clients take too long to receive an up-to-date campaign save at the start of a new round.
- Fixed "received data without a transfer initiation message" errors when a client disconnects and reconnects while a file transfer is in progress.
- Fixed respawn not triggering during multiplayer rounds if a client disconnects and rejoins after dying. Happened because the server was expecting the client to answer the "respawn with penalty?" prompt, which wouldn't be shown when the client rejoins mid-round.
- Fixed server making Client A switch their character to Client B's when Client B disconnects if the clients have the same connection endpoint (Steam ID or IP, for example when the players are using the same wifi connection), and Client B's character was created after Client A's.
- Fixed items sometimes teleporting from monster to another or dropping when trying to pick them up by double-clicking. Happened when the monster had selected (= grabbed, started to eat) another monster when they were still alive.
- Fixed crashing if you start the round as a spectator, take control of someone with console commands and try to access the tab menu's character tab.
- Fixed empty exploding coilgun ammo boxes exploding client-side when deconstructed.
- Fixed disabling friendly fire preventing buffs from being applied to crewmates, while allowing harmful afflictions to be applied (= the setting basically worked the wrong way around).
- Fixed other clients' characters sometimes appearing to teleport outside the sub for 1 frame when moving from sub to another, leading to further issues if the client has water-sensitive items in their inventory.
- Fixed whitelist controls getting disabled when adding new players to the list if whitelist wasn't enabled when opening the server settings.
- Fixed bots losing their items if you quit the 1st MP campaign round without saving, continue, and repeat that again.
- Fixed playstyle always being displayed as Serious in the server lobby unless you're hosting yourself.
- Reduced the severity and frequency of the "Maximum packet size exceeded" error in the server lobby.

- Reworked "beat cop": now gives 25% repair speed and increases inflicted stuns by 25% (and the tackle).
- Reworked "reverse engineer": whenever you deconstruct an alien artifact, you have a 50% chance to gain double output from it and gain 8 to a random skill. Small alien artifacts, when deconstructed, give 4 skill instead.
- Reworked "curiosity": whenever you deconstruct an alien artifact, you and another random allied crewmember gains 125 experience. Small alien artifacts, when deconstructed, give 50 experience instead.
- Reworked "expert commando": now gives, to ranged weapons, 70% spread reduction, 40% attack multiplier and 30% attack speed reduction while crouched.
- Reworked "gene therapist": now gives an additional 25% medical item potency, correctly displays as adding a flat 10% to each refined genetic material.
- Reworked "genetic stability": no longer gives 25% repair speed, and instead gives 15 to all skills. Probability of tainting genetic material reduced to 50%.
- Reworked "still kicking": now rapidly heals over a short duration instead.
- Reworked "stand and deliver": assistant skillbook can no longer be used on another character, instead the nearest ally gains 5 to all skills when the book is read by the talent owner.
- Reworked "first aid training": Now gives a flat 35% increase to medical item potency when applied to the character.
- Reworked "evasive maneuvers": now gives 15% more money for nest/swarm missions instead of giving attack bonus inside submarine.
- Reworked "expanded research": whenever you or another allied crewmember deconstructs depleted fuel, they gain 400 experience. This effect can only occur up to 3 times until you finish another mission.
- "Scrap savant" and "scrounger" only spawn the scrap in items with the tag "container" and only if the container can hold scrap. Fixes ability to generate free scrap by placing containers like detonators and portable pumps in the wrecks.
- "Advanced splicing", "optimized power-flow" and "elbow grease" can now only give up to 100 skill bonus.
- Fixed "canned heat" not increasing the quality of fabricated oxygenite tanks.

- Fixed "safety first" talent giving you mechanical skill when you gain electrical skill instead of the other way around.
- Added PreferredContainers to the new talent items to allow the bots to clean them up.
- Rebalanced combat stimulant: now applies faster, but less in total per dose. Healing reduced.
- Dropped type "poison" from chem addiction, making it non-healable (only chem withdrawal can be healed).

AI:
- New order: Find Weapon
- New order: Prepare for Expedition.
- New order: "Load Items", with options "Recharge battery cells", "Refill oxygen tanks", and "Reload ammo". Bots will take battery cells to be recharged, take oxygen tanks to be refilled, or place more ammo to loaders depending on the order option.
- Added an option to pump in water. Only applicable to pumps that are not automatically controlled.
- Orders that cannot be completed should now be dismissed automatically instead of keeping active but doing nothing.
- The bots should now tell you when they can't follow an order, instead of always replying positively.
- Changes to the default order assignment priorities, which determine the initial order of the orders when multiple is issued. You can still alter the order manually by dragging the order icons.
- Fixed bots getting stuck with invalid paths for too long.
- Fixed AIObjectiveGetItem not working properly when we try to ignore the items that already are in the inventory. In practice, only affects the find better weapons behavior in the combat objective (Fight Intruders).
- Bots don't automatically unequip PUCS when they don't need diving gear.

- Bots now hold still while waiting a door to open instead of moving towards it.
- Bots now only put oxygen tanks into oxygen generators with the "Refill Oxygen Tanks" order option.
- Bots take previous heals into account when determining when to react to attacks. Fixes deusizine and liquid oxygenite aggroing the bots when using them to treat oxygen loss.
- Bots now treat handcuffed targets as neutralized, unless they are hostiles spawned from events. Fixes e.g. bots killing captured prisoners, but also allows you to submit to the outpost guards by handcuffing yourself.
- Prevent bots from healing the targets that have recently attacked them. Fixes bots healing and shooting you at the same time.
- Fixed rescue order (healing) not working outside of the sub.
- Fixed bots not knowing how to use the Rapid Fissile Accelerator. Also improves on how they use smg, assault rifle, and autoshotgun.
- Fixed unconscious NPCs being able to see you steal.
- Fixed bots sometimes repathing too eagerly while they are on ladders, sometimes causing them to get stuck in places where they should switch from a ladder to another one nearby.

- Fixed bots sometimes deploying Kastrull's drone for no reason.
- Improvements to cave waypoints: should fix bots getting stuck next to destructible ice chunks even if there's a way past them.
- Husks now remain neutral towards characters that are late in the husk transformation, unless they act offensively.
- Reduced Husk and Humanhusk sight from 1 to 0.5.
- Oxygenite shards are no longer oxygen sources and can't be inserted into diving gear or tools directly. They are still a source of liquid oxygenite, which can be used to craft oxygenite tanks.
- Added some dialog for the bots when they are getting attacked outside a friendly sub to tell the player why they are fleeing from an enemy and that they don't have a weapon.
- Fixed combat objective overriding the priority of find safety objective when the combat objective shouldn't even be active, leading to bots sometimes suffocating after combat if they don't have enough oxygen in the currently equipped tank.

Misc fixes:
- Exploding the abandoned outpost reactor doesn't damage the player sub in missions that require destroying it.
- Hopefully occasional fixed fires/meltdowns at the start of a round.  Was caused by the "warm start" logic that simulates 10 seconds of power grid updates at the start of a round: if the reactor wasn't running on auto or was controlled by some custom circuit, it wouldn't adapt to the changes in the grid load during those simulated 10 seconds, which could lead to overloads.
- Fixed blips not disappearing from the sonar when it's been repaired above 100% condition by using talents.
- Fixed Security Officer Uniform's and Gunner Uniform's icons being swapped.

- Fixed harpoon rope pulling with excessive forces when the target is on a platform.
- Always snap the rope between the harpoon and the harpoon gun when the harpoon is detached from the target. Possibly fixes cases where physics forces from the rope are still applied when the projectile has dropped. Also applies to fractal guardians.
- Fixed physics glitches with guardian's tail when it switches subs or goes outside.
- Fixed characters sometimes getting teleported to an invalid position when they are exiting/entering the sub and have more than one swarm feeder latched on them.
- Fixed Kastrull and Typhon 2 using different id card tags than the rest of the vanilla sub ("idjob" instead of "id_job").
- Fixed artifact transport cases not reliably suppressing thermal artifact fires.
- Fixed ability to stack batteries in wrecked charging docks.
- Fixed certain signal components (boolean operators, artihmetic, equals, trigonometric, string) triggering at the start of a round when they're set to a timeframe larger than 0.1 s.
- Fabricator drops the items inside the fabrication materials instead of consuming them (e.g. fabricating a combat suit from a normal one with a tank inside doesn't make the tank disappear).
- Fixed deconstructor destroying items contained in the deconstructed item if they can't fit in the output slots.
- Fixed lights becoming full-brightness for one frame when their color is set using the "set_color" input.
- Fixed turret lights' rotation being wrong for one frame when the light is toggled on

- Fixed oxygenite tanks not being affected by gas vents in caves.
- Fixed items disappearing when trying to combine stacks of partially consumed items.
- Fixed upgrading devices' max condition causing issues with repairing: the repair thresholds were being treated as condition values instead of percentages, meaning that the devices would need to deteriorate more before they become repairable.

- Fixed harpoon guns spawning with only 5 harpoons and stun guns with 1 dart.
- Fixed "bombscare" outpost event giving the characters xp for a non-existent "engineering" skill.

- Adjusted flamethrower and prototype steam cannon particles to get them to match the range of the weapons more closely.
- Fixed most outpost modules being named as airlock and consequently defined as "wet rooms". Fixes bots still slamming doors and hatches on each others face while moving around in the outposts.
- Fixed portable pump consuming batteries when it's not pumping in/out.
- Fixed waypoint connections on Remora drone causing navigation issues for the bots.
- Fixed undocking a drone (e.g. on Remora/Kastrull) permanently breaking the navigation between the shuttle and the main sub.
- Fixed mudraptors and crawlers trying to swim to the bottom of the ocean.

- Fixed Round and Ceil components returning -0 when rounding a negative value to 0.
- Fixed inability to swim up through a small hull on top of another one (e.g. the upper airlock in R-29).

- Fixed name of the currently installed turret not being displayed in the submarine upgrade menu.
- Fixed AI gunners not shooting at visible enemies inside the enemy submarine.
- Fixed status monitor's electrical view not showing the power/load values in Korean.
- Fixed bots trying to equip a scooter when their hands are occupied by something that can't be put in the inventory (e.g. a crate), leading to weird twitching when they drop and immediately pick up the carried item.
- Bots stop moving before starting to repair a device. Fixes bots "flying away" when the repair fails, because they'd start the repair while still running at full speed and would keep the momentum if they get stunned because of the failed repair. 
- Fixed looking at the sonar sometimes causing a significant performance hit (most often in the abyss). If a path to a marker couldn't be found when determining the distance to the marker, the game would keep trying to find a path every frame.

- Fixed spawnitem command not working in the sub editor.
- Fixed alien pistol not having a crosshair.
- Fixed weapon skill above 100 making weapons less accurate.
- Fixed cargo sometimes spawning inside the floor. Happened because the spawn position was determined based on the purchased item's size, instead of the crate the item spawns in.
- Fixed campaign getting "locked" if the submarine undocks immediately at the start of the round (on the first frame, e.g. as a result of some custom docking circuit).
- Fixed deconstructor being unable to combine the output items if they're inside a container in the output slots.
- Fixed misaligned outpost reactor meters.
- Fixed sprite bleed in the outpost computer terminal sprite.

Modding:

- Made memory component's "writeable" field editable in the sub editor.
- Fixed all ruin generation params displaying "RuinGenerationParams" as their name in the level editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.13.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Remove spawnpoint-based job assignment logic. Previously, the number of job-specific spawnpoints in the sub affected how many players the server would try to assign to a given job, which would often lead to players not getting the job they wanted to.

- Improvements to the Korean localization.
- Added rewards to side objective missions (hunting grounds, beacon).

- Fixed contained items' impact sounds being played when the item they're inside hits the floor.
- Fixed True Potential instant kills not properly giving kill credit (achievements, other talents).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.15.9.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alien ruin overhaul:
- Overhauled ruins: completely remade sprites, monsters, layouts, items and puzzles.
- New Scan mission: scan an Alien ruin by placing down provided scanners at target locations and take the scanners back to the outpost.
- New Alien Ruin mission: kill the guardians inhabiting the ruin and destroy their pods.
- Added an additional ambience track for the ruins.

Character overhaul:
- Completely remade character sprites, ragdolls and animations.
- Option to customize the starting crew in the single player campaign.
- More customization options (skin, hair and facial hair colors, more accessories).
- Added a button to randomize character appearance in the character customization menus.

Health system improvements:
- Streamlined the health interface.
- Allow administering meds by clicking on the "suitable treatments" suggestions in the health interface.
- The health interface displays a prediction of how much a medical item will reduce/increase the afflictions when hovering the cursor over one.
- Certain afflictions can make the characters' face or body change color.
- Physical injuries to the head can cause concussions.
- Improvements to the blood particle effects when a character is bleeding.
- Damage to arms reduces aiming accuracy.
- Crippled legs slow the player down more.

Talent system:
- The new talent system allows you to unlock things such as special skills, buffs and fabrication recipes in the course of a campaign, with experience points gained from completing missions.
- Three different talent trees for all the character classes.
- Dozens of new items.
- Item quality system: certain talents allow you to fabricate higher-quality versions of items.
- Characters lose some skill points when respawning mid-round. The talent system makes it easier to gain skills and permanent improvements to the character, and this change is intended to balance that out.

Overhauled status monitor:
- Improved visuals.
- Indicates the locations of the crew's ID cards.
- Indicates the locations of alerts.
- Electrical view, indicating locations and health of junction boxes, reactor and batteries.
- Allows searching for items and indicating the hulls in which they're located.

Balance changes:
- Reduced loot in wrecks.
- Difficulty affects the amount of loot.
- Reduced the amount of weapons and grenades in wrecks, pirate ships and abandoned outposts.
- Disabled stacking quality-based items (experimental change, feedback is welcome).
- Reduced diving suits damage resistances.
- Buffed vigor and haste.
- Modified characters' base vitalities.
- Adjustments to monster stats.
- Reduced mission experience gains, level difficulty affects mission experience.
- Made welding tools a bit less effective early to compensate for increases to their effectiveness from quality/talents.
- Upgrade system reworked to work better in conjunction with new talents and quality systems. Quality of life upgrades made better or cheaper, hull upgrades are less effective towards the lategame but are better early, reorganized categories.
- Diving suit and human ragdoll damagemodifier changes: the suits now offer less protection, but humans have a bit more natural protection towards physical damage types.
- Adjustments to outpost distribution: natural formations greatly reduced in the 1st zone, cities slightly reduced in the 1st zone, outposts (including specialized ones) increased in the 3rd and 4th zone.
- Made magnesium a little more common in stores and wrecks.

Additions and changes:
- Gene splicing. You can find alien genetic material inside ruins (and for the time being, wrecks), and use these materials to gain special abilities and buffs. The materials can be processed using a Research Station (which atm can be found in research outposts) and applied on a character using a Gene Splicer.
- Added a new "Return" order for ordering bots to return back to the main submarine.
- Bots can now use level waypoints to help them navigate around when they are outside the submarine.
- Play editor music in the multiplayer lobby.
- Option to specify the amount of items to spawn with the "spawnitem" command.
- Optimized cave vent and ballast flora spore particles.
- Added a 5 second "cooldown" before a junction box broken by overloading can take damage from overloading again. Prevents continuous fires and particles when continuously repairing an overloaded junction box.

- Disabled new status monitor features from handheld status monitors.
- Round water and oxygen percentage readings on the status monitor (e.g. 99.999998% shows up as 100% instead of 99%).
- Adjustments to how far creatures can see and hear the submarine and it's devices from. Moving fast now makes more noise, moving slowly less, and the monsters can't see the sub from as far as before. Effectively it should now be more viable tactic to shut the engines down and keep silent.
- Reduce sonar ping's sound range from 10000 to 8000 to make it possible to spot (some) monsters before they target the sub.
- Made a couple of monsters unable to eat characters (hammerheads, terminal cells, leucocytes, molochs, spinelings and watchers).
- Changed default creature attack key to F because R conflicts with the radio keybind.
- Disabled toggling the sonar mode by pressing the Run key.
- Added condition_out pin to various items.
- Bots no longer ignore unconscious targets that regenerate health (i.e. they will finish off downed husks to prevent them from getting back up again).
- Fabricating fuel rods now requires electrical skills instead of mechanical.
- Reactor now requires electrical skills instead of mechanical to repair.
- When the status monitor receives the oxygen/water level for a hull, it registers it on all the linked hulls as well (-> no need to put an oxygen/water detector in all the hulls of a multi-hull room).
- Removed the "burndamage" damage type (not the same as "burn") that was added as a temporary workaround to allow pulse lasers to bypass monster's damage modifiers.
- Changed the look of the skill/xp notifications to accommodate the larger numbers of notifications you can get from talents and skillbooks.
- Added a fabricator and deconstructor to Azimuth and slightly lowered its maximum speed.
- Increased Azimuth's battery out relay max power.
- Temporarily disabled magnesium exploding in water to prevent issues with talents related to it.
- Added "targetlimb" argument to the giveaffliction command (allows applying the affliction to a specific limb).
- Players who wander inside a respawn shuttle don't get automatically killed when the shuttle despawns if they weren't part of the respawning crew.
- Bots no longer ignore severe fires in reactor, engine, or command rooms. The intention for them ignoring the severe fires was to prevent unwanted casualities when the fire can be left untreated and wait for it to fade out when not ordered to extinguish fires.
- Buffs are transferred to AI-controlled husks when a character transforms.
- Projectiles shift to the left in multi-slot loaders when firing.
- Option to make terminals use a monospaced font.
- Player-controlled monsters can now grab and eat bodies.
- Added triangle and sawtooth wave types to oscillator component.
- Added "high_pressure" output to water detector.
- Water detectors round the water percentage output up, so any amount of water will be at least 1%.
- Focus on the password field automatically in the server password prompt and allow submitting it with enter.
- Made pirates a little less accurate when they're operating turrets: they can no longer magically aim exactly at characters inside another sub.
- Biome noise loop volume is tied to sound volume instead of music volume.
- Endworms no longer always bleed to death when their tail is cut.
- Lever state is visualized on its sprite.
- Enabled NVidia Optimus on Windows.

Fixes:
- Removed duplicate welcome messages from humpack's terminal.
- Fixed start and spectate buttons shrinking in the server lobby every time they're hidden and re-enabled.
- Fixed contained items inside contained items not moving when repositioning a container in the sub editor (e.g. when moving a weapon holder that contains a weapon with a magazine).
- Fixed issues with inaccurate tooltips and incorrectly blocked out order nodes in character-specific command interface.
- Fixed contained items' status effects appearing at the top-left corner of the container if the contained items are not visible (e.g. particle-emitting fuel rods would emit the particles from the top-left corner of the reactor instead of the center).
- Fixed hanging wires not getting selected when selecting the items they're connected to.
- Fixed "divide by zero" console error when scaling construction barrier.
- Fixed ability to wire items between two submarines as long as you stay inside the same sub.
- Fixed crew list background blocking mouse input (again).
- Fixed crashing when the majority of the players are controlling characters belonging to a non-player team while the sub is at the end of the level (e.g. if you're alone in the sub and take control of a monster with console commands).
- Fixed cargo missions sometimes only rewarding the players for 1 crate even when transporting more.
- Fixed the "use as treatment" tooltip showing up when trying to drop an item that can't be used as a treatment on the health interface.
- Fixed characters in the transition phase of a husk infection (i.e. after the stinger has appeared) getting stunned at the start of every round.
- Fixed inability to adjust max mission count in a dedicated server.
- Fixed light components staying powered indefinitely when in a container or inventory (didn't seem to be noticeable on any other vanilla items than sonar beacons, which stayed active indefinitely).
- Fixed some outpost events being possible to activate even if the target NPC is dead.
- Fixed ability to swap contained non-interactable items.
- Fixed crash when loading a container that has no containable restrictions and contains items (e.g. if you put items in a deconstructor and start a new round).
- Fixed bots not swapping oxygen tanks when they are outside and going to a target that is inside.
- Fixed issues with bot combat behavior when outside the submarine.
- Fixed ability to hold 2-handed items with one hand by trying to insert them into an occupied slot in a container that can't hold the item.
- Fixed misaligned nav terminal and status monitor in pirate humpback.
- Fixed inability to install/update mods that have periods in the name.
- Fixed nav terminals "current_position_x" output being in pixels when "current_position_y" is in meters.
- Fixed minerals sometimes spawning in unreachable spots in mining missions (on cells that are next to a cave, but at the wrong side of that cell if there's empty space behind it).
- Fixed items' "allow swapping" property being editable in-game.
- Fixed RegEx components with a non-continuous output always sending a signal out after being loaded.
- Fixed pirate subs sometimes spawning inside floating ice chunks.
- Fixed tracer particles not starting from the position of ranged weapons' barrel.
- Fixed inability to open the pause menu when the cursor is over an inventory slot.
- Fixed handcuffs dropping off from characters' hands when they die or turn into a husk.
- Fixed loadsub command.
- Cap the amount argument of the spawnitem command to 100 to prevent freezing/crashing when trying to spawn a ridiculous amount of the item.
- Fixed "infiltration" event getting stuck on one of the conversation options.
- Fixed signal source being wrong on delayed electrical signals (= signals that were delayed for the next frame after they'd passed through 10 steps). Most noticeably affected status monitors that need to know which oxygen/water detector a signal came from.
- Fixed WifiComponents delaying the signals based on the number of receivers, not how many steps the signal has actually taken, contributing to the previous issue.
- Hopefully fixed an oversight in the sub editor where changing ItemComponent colors with the HSV picker would create an error in the console.
- Fixed paralyzant (and many other meds that don't do direct damage) not triggering guards.
- Fixed sonar monitor's UI being unnecessarily small.
- Fixed contained items inside contained items (e.g. magazines in a rifle on a weapon holder) not rotating in the sub editor.
- The overdosed NPC in the "good samaritan" event can't die until the player has triggered the event (completing the event after the NPC had already died made no sense).
- Fixed console errors when an item a bot has been ordered to target was removed between rounds (e.g. an ignore order targeting a mission item that gets removed at the end of the round).
- Fixes to oxygen generator logic: the generator now periodically recalculates how to distribute the oxygen between the vents, as opposed to doing it once at the start of the round. Just doing it once caused issues if there were e.g. vents or doors that are initially open between the rooms.
- Fixed outpost events always unlocking the same escort mission.
- The hints about flooded rooms and ballast flora aren't shown in ruins, wrecks or enemy subs.
- Fixed "stowaway" event triggering an event cooldown, preventing monsters from spawning at the beginning of the round.
- Fixed clients (excluding the host) always considering friendly fire to be disabled, leading to minor cosmetic desyncs when a player applies afflictions on another one (i.e. there was a brief delay before the afflictions update client-side).
- Fixed inability to apply buffs on the crew when friendly fire is disabled.
- Fixed ItemContainers only applying the StatusEffects from the first matching Containable, even if there's multiple. Prevented the artifact-specific effects of artifact holder from executing.
- Fixed "giveaffliction" command's limbtype argument not working in multiplayer.
- Fixed "linesperlogfile" server setting doing nothing.
- Fixed discharge coils not working when triggered by via a wired button.
- Fixed hatch waypoint and platforms on Remora Drone.
- Memory usage optimizations.
- Fixed bots shooting enemies even when there's a friendly sub between them and the target.
- Bots take their masks off when if they have successfully equipped a suit.
- Fixed a pathfinding issue in Remora caused by too sparse waypoint distribution.
- Fixed disguises not changing the color of a character's name when hovering the cursor over the character.
- Fixed monsters' attack sounds never playing in multiplayer.

Modding:
- Implemented an item variant system that works similar to the character variants: you can create new items that inherit the properties of another item and only modify specific aspects of it, reducing the amount of duplicate XML code. See "Depleted Fuel Rod" in engineer_talent_items.xml for an usage example.
- Option to configure minimum damage for OnDamage status effects that require a specific type of affliction (see the "vigor on damage" affliction for an usage example).
- Option to make afflictions draw a full-screen overlay when active.
- Option to make property conditionals target contained items using the attribute targetcontaineditem="true".
- Added support for tileable light textures for Structures by using <light> XML element that has the same syntax as <LightComponent> does for Items.
- Added "InPressure" property to characters.
- Fixed hidden items appearing in the job loadout preview if there are other items of the same type that are not hidden (didn't affect any vanilla loadouts).
- Removed error message when trying to transfer items to a husk monster and inventory sizes don't match
- Submarine upgrades can be disallowed by category instead of having to do it separately for each upgrade in the sub editor.
- Fixed a modding related crash when trying to apply a property value of a wrong type using status effects.
- Option to create custom husk infections where player control carries over to the transformed creature.
- Display a console warning when an item's deconstruct output defines an out condition and is also set to copy the condition of the deconstructed item.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.14.9.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed an exploit that allowed modified servers to send malicious campaign save files to clients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.14.9.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- If multiple turrets have been linked to the same loader, the turrets can't be swapped individually (both need to be swapped at the same time to prevent turrets from getting linked to an incorrect type of loader).
- Emergency lights don't cast shadows by default (they have such a short range that disabling the shadows usually doesn't make a difference visually, but improves the performance of the subs).
- Allow closing the submarine previews with esc.
- Made ballast pumps in Kastrull's drone indestructible (because they're impossible to access without breaking the walls/floors).
- Made exploding coilgun ammo more expensive and increased the capacity of the ammo boxes a bit.
- Made pirate subs immune to ballast flora.
- Security's stun guns spawn fully loaded.
- Reduced escort missions' base commonness. Doesn't have an effect in the campaign because the commonness is defined in the mission events, but fixes escort missions being much more common than other mission types in mission mode.
- Destroying a reactor with explosives depletes the fuel rods.
- Hide the equipment slots and character portait in wiring mode.
- Added platforms behind Remora Drone's hatches.

Fixes:
- Fixed enemies sometimes not spawning at all during a mission. Happened when the game selected the "stowaway" event to occur during the mission.
- Fixed pirate and escort missions not being available from late-game outposts.
- Fixed occasional "unauthorized multithreaded access to RandSync.Server" errors when starting a pirate mission in multiplayer.
- Fixed crashing with a "E_INVALIDARG" SharpDXException if an ice spire happens to generate on a very short level wall edge.
- Fixed crashing when trying to spawn inventory items for a character who left before respawning during the previous round.
- Fixed batteries always recharging at "full speed" when not full, regardless of how much power is being drawn from the battery. E.g. a battery that's only connected to a lamp drawing 5 kW of power would always recharge at the full 500 kWmin.
- Fixed traitor items sometimes spawning in non-interactable or hidden containers.
- Fixed turret rotation limit widgets working unreliably in the sub editor.
- Fixed barrels being misaligned on scaled turrets in the sub preview.
- Stores don't offer/request sealed supply crates as daily specials.
- Fixed campaign settings (radiation enabled, max missions) resetting when reopening the campaign settings menu.
- Fixed hitscan projectiles not hitting structures outside hulls when the turret itself is inside a hull.
- Fixed inability to swap items between the character's inventory and a container in some situations in multiplayer (when the container was right at the edge of the character's interaction range).
- Fixed bots being unable to repair the pump in Typhon's bottom airlock.
- Fixed crashing when repairing or fabricating something as a husk (or some other character with no CharacterInfo).
- Fixed crashing when reviving someone using CPR as a character with no CharacterInfo (e.g. husk).
- Fixed upgrades using the original value from a previous item when swapping to a new one (e.g. swapping a railgun to a coilgun sets the power consumption to the railgun's power consumption). More specifically, this happened when the campaign was saved and reloaded after purchasing the upgrade, and the item was swapped after that.
- Fixed wrecks sometimes being positioned right side of the exit position.
- Fixed characters not getting knocked down at the last stage of husk infection if they have the Vigor buff.
- Fixed discharge coil triggering when trying to rewire it.
- Fixed some ActionTypes having the same value (e.g. OnFire == OnDamaged). Caused wrong type of status effects triggering in some cases, for example OnDamage effects when an indestructible thalamus organ is on fire.
- Fixed items that are set to be hidden in-game being visible in the sub preview.
- Fixed bots being unable to weld leaks that are too high above them, even if they're actually in reach. Happened because the distance to the leak was calculated relative to the character's position, even though the range of the welding tool is relative to the character's shoulder.
- Fixed cargo mission rewards being displayed incorrectly when there's multiple cargo missions selected and not enough capacity for all the cargo.
- Fixed caret getting misplaced when clicking on a textbox with padding.
- Fixed headset only being able to send signals to each wifi component once.
- Fixed bots sometimes ignoring broken devices. Happened when another bot had selected the device as their repair target, even if the bot was currently repairing something else.
- Fixed nav terminal labels sometimes being draw under linked status monitor HUDs.
- Fixed bots sometimes not fixing airlock doors/hatches. More specifically, doors whose center point was outside a hull.
- Fixed medic bots grabbing the target and never letting go when there's no suitable treatments available anywhere in the sub, or when they're in an outpost and not carrying any suitable treatments.
- Fixed bots suffocating when they run out of oxygen tanks if ordered to wait wearing a suit.
- Fixed ability to select other items when operating periscopes. Didn't cause problems in vanilla subs, but in custom subs where the turret was placed close to the periscope and other interactable items, it was possible to accidentally select something else when trying to fire.
- Made nav terminal's "velocity_in" input change the target velocity, not just the steering input, making it possible to adjust the velocity with signals when using autopilot.
- Fixed text fields in a component's editing menu not refreshing until you've interacted with another component.
- Fixed ruins sometimes overlapping with level walls (when they happen to spawn next to a very large cell).
- Fixed ability to "partially open" the health interface in the sub editor, causing the inventory layout to get messed up when clicking on the character portrait even though the health interface isn't drawn.
- Fixed ability to keep dragging an item from a stunned/ragdolled character's inventory after they get back up.
- Fixed nuclear weapons not damaging ballast flora.
- Fixed normal uniforms deflecting projectiles even though they shouldn't.
- Fixed clients who've opted to spawn with reaper's tax getting a new character if the round ends before the client respawns.
- Fixed occasional crash with the error message "collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute" when loading mods on startup.
- Fixed ability to keep dragging the previously equipped wire in the sub editor after you equip another wire with the wire hotkeys.
- Fixed characters' sprite depth changing during the "autowalk" towards a bed or chair.
- Require the sub to move a bit faster to crush characters between the sub and a wall. Previously essentially any non-zero velocity was enough to crush a character, even if the sub didn't appear to move.
- Fixed nests sometimes getting placed outside caves. Happened when the game tried to position the nest above an opening at the bottom of the cave.
- Fixed inability to use the health interface on the escorted characters.
- Fixed 1st client (usually the host) always spawning at the same spawnpoint in multiplayer even if there's multiple suitable ones available.
- Fixed stacked partially used items (e.g. stacked explosives that have been damaged) dropping from character inventories at the start of a round.
- Fixed occasional freezing when replacing lost shuttles after purchasing submarine upgrades.
- Adjusted Endworm's colliders so that you can't hit the tail between the armor segments before first breaking the armor (making it less easy to cut the worm in half).
- Fixed hull properties not carrying over when copying hulls in the sub editor.
- Fixed occasional "collection was modified" exception in CargoMission.DetermineCargo. Happened if the client received an updated campaign save while trying to load the sub between rounds.
- Fixed a broken waypoint in Berilia's cargo bay.
- Fixed seeds sometimes vanishing when trying to plant them in MP.
- Fixed planter boxes displaying the "uproot" message when empty.
- Fixed depth charges going through doors and hatches.
- Fixed ability to dock docking hatches to ports and vice versa.
- Fixed camera being able to focus on a turret when a periscope's "position_out" connection is wired to a turret's "power_in" connection.
- Fixed water detectors not detecting very small (water depth < 1px) amounts of water in hulls.
- Fixed duffel bags not spawning at the end of a round if the character hasn't despawned/respawned yet (i.e. if the character's corpse is still present in the sub).
- Fixed wrecked Dugong's distress signal being impossible to receive due to "allow cross-team communication" being set to false on the wifi component sending the signal.
- Fixed fabricator being unable to stack empty items in the output slots, preventing empty tanks from being fabricated when the output slots are occupied even if additional tanks could be stacked on them.
- Fixed messed up "Shuttle Shell A Glass A" sprite.
- Fixed delay components not working if the delay is set to 0.
- Fixed loaders getting slightly misaligned when swapping an empty hardpoint with some weapon.
- Fixed pumps placed in the sub editor being off by default.
- Fixed weapon skill increases not being capped according to the max vitality of the target. Resulted in enormous weapon skill gains when doing massive amounts of damage (more than the target's max vitality), e.g. by shooting a hammerhead matriarch in the egg sack with a nuke.
- Fixed ability to delete vanilla beacon stations and pirate subs in the sub editor.
- Fixed pirate subs sometimes spawning in side paths that are too narrow for the sub to pass through.
- Fixed an exploit that allowed creating game-crashing infinite signal loops using wifi components.
- Fixed a typo in the abyss diving suit description (100,000 m -> 10,000 m).
- Fixed several vanilla sub docking hatches requiring a welding tool instead of a wrench to repair them.
- Fixed "Operate Weapons" order being available when interacting with a turret directly, leading to a crash when trying to do so.
- Fixed missions disappearing from abandoned outposts after finishing the campaign.
- Fixed canister shells refilling automatically between rounds.
- Fixed turrets working with incorrect loader types (e.g. coilgun being able to fire laser bolts when linked to a pulse laser loader).
- Fixed "exterior pressure exceeds diving suit capabilities" hint popping up when carrying a diving suit.
- Fixed biome noise loops still playing after the round ends.
- Fixed detonator rapidly draining condition from flash powder and incendium instead of exploding them immediately (potentially resulting in partially used items).
- Fixed exploit in plastiseal crafting recipe (plastiseal deconstructing to 1 bandage even though 1 bandage can be used to craft 2 plastiseal).
- Fixed RepairTools applying their effects multiple times to items whose bodies consist of multiple fixtures. Caused minerals to get deattached 3 times faster than they should.
- Fixed AFK kicks when staying in any of the campaign UIs (store, etc) or other input-blocking menus for too long.
- Fixed monsters sometimes targeting owners of targeted items although the owner is ignored.
- Fixed some items held in the left hand rendering in front of the character's thigh.
- Fixed characters being focusable through UI elements (e.g. item interfaces), causing accidental interactions when the NPC interaction key is bind to LMB.

Modding:
- Added support for "additive" event sets which get added on top of another normal event set, allowing mods to spawn additional types of monsters without having to touch the vanilla event sets. See the "transitevents" event set in OutpostEvents.xml for an usage example.
- Fixed subs appearing to disappear after being published in the Workshop, because the content package the sub gets moved to wasn't automatically selected.
- Fixed MaxTargetsToHit not working on hitscan projectiles.
- Fixed offsets not being taken into account when positioning contained items, causing status effects to happen at the position of the container instead of the position of the contained item. Didn't have a noticeable effect in the vanilla game because most contained items are positioned close to the container's origin.
- Fixed spawnpoint's job restrictions being ignored when spawning pirates and escortees.
- It's now possible to use multiple equipped WifiComponents at the same time: instead of finding the first equipped item and seeing if it can receive/transmit, the game now goes through the items until it finds one that can.
- Fixed crashing when trying to pick an item that can't be put in any type of inventory slot from a container. Doesn't happen in the vanilla game because there are no such items in any container.
- Fixed crashing during wreck generation if there's any thalamus organs outside hulls.
- Fixed crashing if a wall whose max health is set to 0 in the sub editor takes damage.
- Fixed crashing if a reactor's maximum output is set to 0 and it's set to be on by default.
- Fixed a crashing due to a null reference exception if a status effect uses "target" instead of "targets" or "targettypes" in the definition.
- Fixed shuttles docked to a wreck undocking during level generation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.14.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed "entity not found" errors when receiving attack data for a character that's been removed (most often a terminal cell).
- Fixed occasional "mission equality check failed" errors when starting a round with multiple missions selected.
- Fixed outpost events not triggering in levels with a difficulty between 40-41.
- Fixed hunting grounds missions only spawning endworms.
- Fixed 2nd part of the Jacov Subra event chain not triggering.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.14.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed deconstructing chaingun/laser ammo boxes not giving back aluminium.
- Fixes certain particles (e.g. flare) "dragging behind" inside moving subs.
- Fixed Typhon 2's railgun not being connected to the loader.
- Fixed occasional "failed to read event for xxx" errors when syncing a pirate's AI state in multiplayer.
- Fixed atan components working unreliably when using the separate x/y inputs.
- Fixed missing prisoner outfit sprite.
- Crates pre-placed into a submarine's cargo containers or ULD's aren't taken into account when calculating the cargo capacity to display in the submarine preview.
- Fixed limbs getting automatically deselected in the health interface when receiving a new affliction (most noticeable when trying to heal an affliction that's being continuously applied on the character, e.g. burns caused by radiation).
- Added a missing hull to beacon station's airlock room.
- Fixed inventory toggle button being rendered in the top-left corner of the screen when grabbing a character with a 0-capacity inventory (such as a hatchling).
- Fixed an exploit that allowed crashing the game using certain looping circuits that involve trigonometric function components.
- Removed underwater explosion particle effect when vomiting underwater.
- Fixed screen noise effect cutting from white to black with no blending when the oxygen low affliction kicks in while the white noise effect (e.g. radiation sickness) is active.
- Fixed ability to set the reactor's turbine output or fission rate outside the allowed range of 0-100 using the "set_fissionrate" and "set_turbineoutput" inputs.
- Fixed crashing when opening the weapon customization menu when there's non-swappable turrets in the sub.
- Fixed misaligned light sprites on nav terminal and status monitor.

Modding:
- Fixed crashing when trying to create a thalamus when there's no wreck AI configs available in the selected content packages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.14.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Submarine weapons can be swapped in the outposts.
- Added Pulse Laser and Chaingun.
- Added Canister Shells (a reloadable burst-type munition for the railgun).
- Added escort missions.
- Added pirate missions.
- Option to choose multiple missions per level.
- Made it possible to sell items on the sub through a new store tab in singleplayer.
- Cargo now spawns in crate shelves and "Unit Load Devices" (large containers mostly used in cargo subs). The amount of cargo you can transport depends on the number of the shelves/ULDs, and the cargo mission rewards scale according to the cargo capacity. If there's no shelves or ULDs, you can still transport a small number of crates on the cargo room's floor like before.
- Made upgrades affect all submarines. Old purchased submarines will have their upgrades overridden by the currently loaded submarine's upgrades.
- The previous music track continues playing when the game switches back from the "intensity tracks" to normal music.
- Made it possible to carry diving suits and toolbelts in hands. We could use some feedback on the way this works: is it intuitive, should there be a separate key for picking them up...?
- The ice shards and exploding mushrooms in caves can be destroyed with weapons and explosives.
- Added tracer particles to raycast projectiles (hitscan).
- Increased sonar beacon range.
- Color character names according to the team when using the Health Scanner HUD.
- Allow combining elastin.
- Character orders and ignore orders now persist between rounds and saved sessions.
- Added indicators for the tasks the bots are currently doing when they are not following the orders.
- Revisited the random (monster) events: more Watchers and Tigerthreshers, less Crawlers. Fixed a number of issues. Feedback appreciated. (WIP)
- Numerous fixes and improvements on particle effects.
- Changed how autonomous steering objective works. Captains now idle near the helm instead of standing next to the nav terminal.
- Only show the "Save and Quit" button when the game can be saved. Renamed the button in the lobby to "Quit". Saving in multiplayer is done like in single player: on level transitions and on exit from an outpost.
- Updated sounds for Endworm and the electrical discharger.
- Increased the stun of smg rounds from 0.125 to 0.15 to give it a bit more stopping power.
- Lowered Husks' health regeneration and bleeding reduction. Crawler Husks now regenerate too. Lowered their health a bit to compensate it.
- Hammerhead and Golden Hammerhead: Increased health, added some protection on claws and the tail end. Slightly increase the slow swimming speed and animations. The claws don't break anymore when shot with coilgun.
- Hammerheads and Husks don't avoid gun fire anymore. Pets now avoid gun fire.
- Removed Endworm's weak point in the mouth.
- Most outpost events no longer trigger automatically, but require interacting with a specific item/character.
- Taking items that contain stolen items counts as stealing, so you can't for example put a toolbox inside an outpost cabinet, load it full of items and then take it.
- Added a button for resetting in-game hints to the settings.
- Mention diving suits' depth limits in their descriptions.
- Modified the locked path tooltips to mention the officer in the outpost.
- Reset reactor fission rate, turbine output and temperature to optimal levels at the start of a round. Prevents the reactor from catching fire at the start of a round if it was being operated at a high fission rate at the end of the previous round.
- Removed ability to drag and drop seeds into planters.
- Added ability to load .sub, .xml, .png and .jpeg files in sub editor by dragging and dropping them onto the game window.
- Added new biome-specific background noise tracks.
- Improved the command interface minimap view by adding connector lines between icons and item positions to better visualize which item each icon is linked to.
- Projectiles go through severed limbs.
- Docking ports can't be rewired in outpost levels because it can be abused to force to submarine to depart from the outpost.
- Allow clicking on the main menu buttons when the credits are open.
- Option to adjust motion sensor's update interval in the sub editor.

Fixes:
- Fixed clients timing out at the start of a multiplayer round if loading the campaign save takes more than 30 seconds.
- Fixed previous missions still being available in outposts that have become abandoned due to radiation.
- Fixed eggs sometimes spawning partially inside walls in abandoned outpost missions.
- Fixed thalamus walls' colliders still being present even if the wreck doesn't contain a thalamus, preventing entering the sub from places where thalamus walls used to be.
- Fixed minerals sometimes not being mineable in outposts.
- Fixed small characters being unable to avoid the edges of the hulls when idling.
- Save submarine and characters' inventories when saving and quitting an mp campaign round in an outpost.
- Marked "control" console command as a cheat.
- Fixed items sometimes disappearing client-side when the server corrects their position from outside to inside.
- The traitor mission to sabotage the engine doesn't require sabotaging shuttle engines.
- Stacks of seeds can't be put into planters.
- Fixed non-repeatable events (e.g. mission events) no longer appearing after completing the campaign.
- Fixed security officers using head set batteries when their stun batons are out of batteries, causing them to be unable to hear or receive orders (#5681).
- Fixed security officers often handcuffing you after one hit with stun baton (#5649).
- Fixed ignore orders not being properly synced when joining a multiplayer game mid-round.
- Fixed abyss monsters not spawning if there's any player sub (including the respawn shuttle) above the abyss.
- Fixed "are you sure you want to depart without a mission" prompt popping up even if there's no missions available.
- Fixed health bars showing up through walls.
- Fixed horizontal docking ports sometimes docking from the wrong side in mirrored subs.
- Fixed mouse wheel zooming the nav terminal view when the server log (or any other UI element) is blocking it.
- Fixed campaign's initial text popup getting stuck if the sub automatically undocks at the start of a round.
- Non-empty items (ammo boxes, fuel rods, etc) can't be recycled.
- Made airlock door assembly behave a bit more reliably. The circuit in the assembly simply toggles the state of both doors, meaning that one of the doors needs to always be closed and the other open for the logic to work correctly. If using the assembly in a respawn shuttle, it'd break when the shuttle leaves and it's doors are forced to close.
- Fixed inability to go through docking ports when the door/hatch at the other side is broken.
- Fixed other entities' sprites disappearing when reloading a sprite in the sub editor.
- Fixed Remora drone's docking hatch being repairable with a welding tool instead of a wrench.
- Fixed some of Remora drone's walls being transparent.
- Fixed rotation of mirrored items getting messed up when saving and reloading a sub.
- Fixed inability to detach items attached outside the sub.
- Fixed items that are inside a hull being difficult to target from outside the sub (docking ports/hatches in particular).
- Fixed crashing when trying to load a campaign save that contains pets that can't be found (e.g. if you've saved while using a mod that adds custom pets and try to load the save in the vanilla game).
- Fixed crashing when trying to change a location's type to a type that can't be found (e.g. if a mod includes custom location types which are configured incorrectly).
- Fixed "Ignore This" order affecting all NPCs. It should only affect the bots in a player team.
- Fixed "Ignore This" order restricting player access to doors.
- Fixed bots targeting same targets when fixing/repairing.
- Fixed monsters sometimes getting stuck "dancing" near the submarine because they try to avoid and target it at the same time.
- Monster events: Fixed many higher difficulty subsets spawning multiple monster events when they should spawn only one.
- Fixed items taken from abandoned outposts sometimes reappearing when returning to the outpost.
- Fixed highlighting items sometimes breaking after dropping a metal crate or some other container whose inventory is always visible when the item is equipped.
- Fixed bots putting minerals in the closest locker instead of preferring those that have been tagged with the "mineralcontainer" tag
- Fixed bots not respecting the access restrictions when choosing a where to put items into.
- Fixed bots being able to take items from secure cabinets if the item is inside another container inside the cabinet.
- Fixes to hull generation between docking ports. Should fix tiny gaps between the hulls that caused characters to briefly teleport outside the sub when passing through the port, and hulls generating incorrectly when the main submarine has hulls at both sides of the docking port.
- Fixed captain's pipe, harmonica and pipe tobacco not spawning in crates when purchased.
- Fixed console errors when trying to overwrite an existing item assembly in the sub editor.
- Fixed the margin calculations that in some cases made it impossible for Bonethreshers (and possibly other monsters) to reach a moving target.
- Fixed abyss monsters sometimes being unable to hit the sub and just keep pushing the sub.
- Define "tool", "weapon", and "provocative" targeting params to be ignored if the creature is not in the same sub as the target. Fixes some odd cases where the monsters e.g. target some item inside the sub when they are outside.
- Fixed occasional excessive camera shake when a large monster is lodged between the sub and the level.
- Fixed ballast flora not getting cleared from respawn shuttles when the shuttle despawns.
- Fixed ability to switch back to a sub you've left behind using the outpost terminals.
- Fixed doors without integrated buttons getting instantly opened by clicking on them when you have access to the button.
- Fixed ability to switch control to the hostages with Z and X keys during hostage missions.
- Fixed abyss and combat suits not getting autofilled with oxygen tanks when placing the initial supplies to a sub.
- Fixed inability to type in the "max players" field in the "host server" tab.
- Fixed item sell quantity sometimes appearing "maxed out" at a quantity less than what the player is actually selling.
- Fixed crashing when the team id argument for the "spawn" console command is formatted incorrectly, mention the argument in the command's help text.
- Fixed bots trying to clean up seeds and put items into bags that were moved to somewhere the bot can't access them, causing the bot to be stuck trying to reach the target.
- Fixed missions sometimes unlocking in paths leading to an irradiated location even if there's a more suitable path available.
- Fixed white rectangle around selected items in the sub editor being slightly off if the item's position/size is not a whole number.
- Fixed "incorrect password" text overlapping with the buttons in the password prompt.
- Fixed z-fighting in Medium Weapons Display Case.
- Fixed inability to drop through broken hatches.
- Fixed sprite bleed in IC-4 block's inventory icon.
- Fixed healthbar and affliction area being clickable even if there's an UI element in front of them, and even if there's no afflictions in the affliction area. Most noticeable when editing an electrical components properties.
- Fixed some incorrect room names in the beacon stations.
- Fixed propeller damage area triggering very inaccurately, particularly on shuttle engines.
- Fixed hull indicators fading in when loading a sub in the editor (they should only get hidden and fade in when editing the ambient light value).
- Fixed gaps sometimes getting linked incorrectly to the hulls between docking hatches, preventing water from flowing down from the lower hull in mirrored subs. Happened in mirrored Kastrull for example.
- Fixed fires in hulls between docking ports never going out client-side.
- Fixed nav terminal's, sonar monitor's and status monitor's selection rectangles being offset from the sprite in the sub editor.
- Fixed mirrored pumps emitting particles from the wrong side of the pump.

Modding:
- Made it possible to use StatusHUD components in non-equippable items like turrets.
- Fixed scripted event's StatusEffectAction not being able to target ItemComponents.
- Added support for making missions trigger scripted events.
- Option to configure the color of an explosion's flash.
- Option to configure the number of gates between biomes (see MapGenerationParameters.xml).
- Turret's barrel and rail sprites are shown in the sprite editor.
- Made SecondaryUse status effects work with melee and ranged weapons.
- Renamed "Inflitrate" to "CanOpenDoors" and rewrote the tooltip.
- Added "scalemultiplier" (Vector2) for particle emitters so that the effects can be scaled just in one axis instead of both.
- Fixed overriding nav terminals with a mod resetting the changes to the custom interface buttons.
- Fixed status effect conditionals that check a parent container's tags checking the container's components, not just the item itself. Resulted in tag inequality checks always succeeding, because the components don't have any tags.
- Fixed crashing if a scripted event tries to spawn a human prefab that can't be found (i.e. if a mod uses a non-existent human prefab identifier).
- RemoveItemAction can be used to remove tagged items directly, not just items in a tagged character's inventory.
- Replaced "spawnprobability" attribute in monster events with a generic "probability" attribute that can be used for any type of event.
- Option to spawn particles across the ray cast from a hitscan projectile (see "pulselaserbolt").
- Fixed linked subs included in outpost modules being positioned incorrectly.
- Added "swapidentifier" to SwappableItem definitions. Can be used to restrict which items in a given category can be swapped with each other (e.g. if you want to add custom upgradeable turrets but not make them swappable with the vanilla turrets).
- Made SecondaryUse status effects work with ranged weapons.
- Added "equal" targeting tag to enemy AI. Makes it possible to define how monsters react to monsters with the same combat strength.
- TagAction can be used to tag characters based on the human prefab identifier.
- Fixed a crash in the character editor that happened when a humanoid character had an elbow joint but didn't (yet) have a wrist joint.
- The "avoid gun fire" parameter now defaults to false.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.13.3.11
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Adjusted autopilot logic to make it better at keeping the sub afloat when there's extra water on board. The maximum velocity of the autopilot is limited, which previously prevented it from emptying the ballast fully. Now it's only limited if the submarine is heading in the correct direction with enough speed, so if the sub starts sinking due to extra water, the autopilot can compensate and fully empty the ballast.
- Made large monsters immune to sufforin.

Fixes:
- Fixes to issues that prevented mods installed from the Workshop from getting automatically updated and caused errors when trying to join modded servers.
- Fixed an issue in the voice chat that caused audio crackling when multiple people were speaking at the same time.
- Fixed inability to drag players who've ragdolled themselves with space bar.
- Fixed "failed to send message to remote peer" error spam when a client's internet connection goes down.
- Fixed certain submarines spawning with a non-neutral ballast level (Kastrull seems to have been the only affected vanilla submarine). Happened because the game would determine the neutral ballast level from the first nav terminal it finds in the sub, without checking whether that terminal controls a shuttle or the sub itself.
- Fixed explosions using wall damage value instead of level wall damage when the explosion happens outside a level wall.
- Fixed inability to place oxygenite tanks in oxygen tank shelves.
- Fixed crashing when a bot tries to find a diving suit inside ruins.
- Fixed minor wall draw order issue in Orca's top deck.
- Fixed bots trying to treat nausea even though the only cure for it is to wait it out.
- Fixed status monitor being messed up on mirrored subs that contain shuttles.
- Fixed railgun payloads not exploding.
- Fixed server sometimes assigning players who haven't set any job preferences as the captain, even if someone else wants to be the captain.
- Fixed ancient weapon propelling the character in an incorrect direction when using it underwater.
- Fixed sonar beacons not appearing on the sonar in the sub editor's test mode.
- Fixed "easterbunny" traitor mission failing after the mudraptor hatches.
- Fixed "changes to your character will be applied after the round ends" texts getting drawn behind the tab menu elements.
- Fixed "IsToggle" setting not working on periscopes.
- Fixed "Praise the Honkmother" mission being impossible to complete because it required more items to be delivered than the crate contains.
- Fixed humanhusk's inventory not being visible while controlling one.
- Fixed sub editor's entity list getting cleared when changing the entity category while a container/cabinet is selected.
- Fixed items that have been edited in the sub editor (e.g. recolored clothing) reverting back to default when starting a new campaign round while the item is in a character's inventory.
- Fixed clicking on command interface nodes crashing the game if the key is rebound to primary mouse button.
- Fixed tiling issues in some of the legacy background wall sprites.
- Fixed Spinelings attacking Leucocytes. Spinelings should avoid Leucocytes if they get close.
- Fixed bots being unable to stand on the platform below Humpback's docking hatch, preventing them from repairing the hatch.
- Fixed "beacon station" text and "generating preview..." in the submarine preview window not being translated when playing in a language other than English.

Modding:
- Fixed console errors when a character with no gender tries to wear clothing that only has separate male and female sprites.
- Fixed crashing if the current style doesn't define a saving indicator.
- Fixed inability to load ragdoll/animation definitions from mods that override a character.
- Fixed ClearTagAction not properly clearing all the tags assigned by a scripted event.
- Fixed crashing if a mod's version number is incorrectly formatted in filelist.xml.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.13.0.11
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Campaign changes:
- Replaced "Lair" locations with "hunting grounds" in the connections between levels. Inhabited locations next to hunting grounds have a chance of getting abandoned and habitation can't spread through those levels to adjacent locations. The hunting grounds can be cleared by killing a boss monster in the level.
- Beacon stations are shown on the campaign map.
- Visual changes to the map to make it a bit more intuitive.
- When you enter a level with a beacon station, you always get an optional side objective to restore it even if you haven't selected a beacon mission.
- Added radiation on the campaign map: the intensity of the radiation around Jupiter is slowly increasing, which is forcing Europans to delve deeper under the ice. In practice, the radiation gradually destroys the outposts starting from the left side of the map, making it more dangerous and costly to stay in these areas. The intention behind this is to prevent players from farming resources indefinitely in the low-difficulty areas of the game before proceeding further.
- Gating progress between biomes: you need a certain amount of money or reputation before you can enter the next biome.
- Reworked exit points at uninhabited locations: there's a hole/tunnel above the start/end of the level the sub needs to enter to leave.

Abyss:
- Reintroduced Endworm and Charybdis.
- Added floating islands that contain caves and rare minerals to the Abyss.

New player experience:
- Added in-game hints, designed to help with new player onboarding. Can be disabled in the settings.
- Added text highlighting to mission descriptions.
- Player-controlled characters get automatically assigned an appropriate order when the game starts to guide the player on what they should do and to make it easier to find the relevant device(s).
- Changed the camera animation at the start of the campaign to show the entire outpost.
- Display mission difficulty in the available missions list, the info tab, and the round summary.
- Show an indicator when the campaign is saved.

Changes and additions:
- Added abandoned outposts.
- New mission types for abandoned outposts: destroying the outpost, clearing a nest, hostage rescue and assassination.
- Added entity subcategories to the submarine editor.
- Added interactive submarine previews to the server lobby and "New Game" screen.
- Added respawning mid-round in the multiplayer campaign mode. Respawning gives you an affliction that can be healed for a cost at outposts. You can also choose not to respawn mid-round, and instead wait for the next round to spawn normally without the affliction, just like before.
- Reworked the impacts to the sub when it's hit by monsters. Increased the screen shake and stunning. There's now a 30 second cooldown for getting knocked down. Fixed the impact not triggering if the colliding limb is not big enough.
- Reworked attacks and effects for the following creatures: Moloch, Black Moloch, Hammerhead, Hammerhead Matriarch, and Golden Hammerhead. They now have a bigger impact on the sub when they hit it. Black Moloch's emp damage is halved.
- Added Abyss Diving Suits which slows down your movement speed but offers more protection against pressure and consumes oxygen more slowly than the normal suits.
- Added Combat Diving Suits which slow you down less than normal suits and offer more protection against damage.
- Added black moloch mission variants.
- Moloch's shell now always breaks when shot with a railgun.
- Increased the audio ranges for Watcher and Hammerhead Matriarch.
- Overhauled tab menu: improved layout, added submarine and reputation tabs, current funds are displayed in the campaign mode.
- Recreated waypoints for the vanilla subs.
- Bots can now be renamed through the outpost crew management interface.
- Certain large monsters' (endworm, charybdis, boss variants of molochs and hammerheads) health bars become visible at the top of the screen when you damage them.
- Added EMP effect to nuclear shells. Increased the damage a bit.
- Added a right click context menu option to copy debug console errors to clipboard.
- Railgun shells now explode instead of piercing armor. Physicorium shells still go through armor. Make all railgun ammunition slightly more likely to break limb joints.
- Added multiple current orders: you can assign up to three simultaneous orders for characters and drag the icons to change their priority.
- NPCs (non-bots) speak report related lines less than they used to.
- The bleeding particles are now emitted from the last matching limb instead of the first. Readjusted particle emit frequency and scale.
- Reduced Moloch's bleeding reductions.
- Trying to pick up a diving suit when you're already wearing one swaps the suits.
- Made monster eggs glow to make them easier to spot in caves and abandoned outposts.
- Exploding oxygen/fuel tanks don't make other tanks explode.
- Added a delay to oxygen/fuel tank explosions.
- Disconnect wires from beacon stations instead of deleting the wires completely.
- The probability of disconnected wires in beacon stations is relative to the level's difficulty, and no wires are removed if the difficulty is less than 20.
- Improved server filters: instead of only being able to search for servers that have a certain setting enabled/disabled, the filter can be set to "Any" (thanks someone972!).
- Show whether a server is player-hosted or dedicated in the server list.
- Show whether a server is public or private in the server lobby.
- Added a server setting for locking all default wiring in subs.
- Added favorite button to the server lobby.
- Banning a player who's using Steam Family Sharing will now also ban the owner's account, solving ban evasion using this method.
- Disabled NPC conversations in sub editor test mode.
- Beacon stations' reactors don't deteriorate or consume fuel to prevent the station from going back down when the player is travelling out from the level.
- The output length of all signal components is now restricted to 200 characters by default to prevent performance and networking issues if the output is set to an excessively long value (such as the entire dialog of the Bee Movie). The limit can be increased in the sub editor.
- Stunning still works on friendly characters even if friendly fire has been disabled on a server.
- Made radiation sickness's icon appear before it starts causing burns (instead of working the other way around).
- Made radiation sickness cause nausea.
- Added a screen distortion effect for radiation sickness.
- Added a checkbox to color component that toggles between RGBA and HSV input.
- Fabricators now display remaining time when fabricating.
- Revisited husk animations, movement speeds, and general balance. Husks regenerate a lot and are a bit tougher than they used to be. Human husks can and will easily rise again, unless properly killed.
- Adjustments and fixes on the thresher attacks.
- Revisit mudraptors' attacks. Fixes unarmored mudraptors and mudraptor hatchlings acting weird when attacking characters in water.
- Lower the overall damage of all the hatchlings.
- Added a link to the wiki to the main menu.
- Drop empty/used oxygen tank from diving suit when trying to swap in a new one when the inventory is full.
- When using an equipped item from a stack (e.g. a medical item), another item from the same stack is automatically equipped.
- The mid-round mission messages (e.g. "the monster is dead, navigate out...") are shown in the tab menu's mission tab.
- Make characters grabbable and the inventories accessible after a half a second delay. Fixes abusing the toy hammer to access NPC inventories.
- Allow fabricating fresh fuel rods, welding fuel and coilgun ammunition using depleted ones.
- Restrict the length of the text that can be entered as a sonar beacon's sonar label.

Fixes:
- Major improvements to the voice chat: higher audio quality, less intrusive radio effect, fixed clicks/distortion.
- Attempt to fix crashes with the error message "failed to generate OpenAL/stream buffer" on Mac.
- Fixed crashing on startup with the error message "unable to load shared library 'freetype6' or one of its dependencies" on some Linux systems.
- Removed outdated steamclient.so file from the dedicated server (no longer needed because it's automatically installed by Steamworks). Should fix inability to host dedicated servers on Linux.
- Fixed clients' job preferences not being respected in all cases where they should, resulting in some clients getting a job that should be give to another client.
- Items can't be stacked in the equip slots (e.g. you can't hold and throw a stack of grenades).
- Trying to pick up a stack of items with a full inventory doesn't pick up the item in both hand slots.
- Fixes/improvements to item position syncing. When trying to pick up an item whose position has gotten desynced, the server should correct the item's position immediately.
- Fixed turrets getting cropped by the "wikiimage" console command.
- Fixed items with nothing but a holdable component (e.g. medical items) being hidden when hiding wires in the sub editor.
- Fixed ban list not displaying ban reasons or the duration of the ban.
- Fixed items appearing misplaced when switching to the sub editor mid-round with console commands.
- Fixed shuttles spawning undocked in certain custom subs (e.g. DOMA Prototype Mk 8).
- Fixed "tried to add a dead character to CrewManager" console error when reviving a character who died of high pressure.
- Fixed skill levels not getting updated in the "my character" tab mid-round.
- Fixed clients not calculating eventmanager intensity, preventing any high-intensity tracks from playing in multiplayer.
- Fixed campaign map being closed with RMB even if the user has inverted their mouse buttons.
- Fixed damage sometimes desyncing when the sub hits walls/spires: happened because damage was also applied client-side, which sometimes caused the clients to damage walls that weren't actually hit server-side.
- Fixed physics bodies between docking ports not getting mirrored in mirrored subs, sometimes causing impassable areas in spots where the docking port used to be.
- Fixed status monitor in a docked shuttle sometimes not displaying the main sub.
- Fixed campaign stores sometimes displaying prices for a previous location.
- Fixed various scaling issues on higher resolutions.
- Fixed monsters fluttering while pursuing other creatures. Only happened while swimming and was not notable on all monsters).
- Fixed mouse cursor being switched to hand even when the spritesheet is not shown in the character editor.
- Fixed monsters with low head/torso torques moving backwards when they try to turn around 180 degrees.
- Fixed regular Moloch not bleeding correctly.
- Fixed Workshop mod download prompt looping and freezing when there's a hash mismatch after a mod has already been installed.
- Fixed ability to walk through the heavy doors in mining outposts.
- Fixed nav terminal ignoring velocity_in signals when the terminal hasn't been operated by anyone during the round.
- Fixed one of the engineer variants having too many items in the toolbelt.
- Fixed "hide incompatible" checkbox in the server browser.
- Fixed characters getting impact damage from collisions with sensors. Caused characters to get stunned when they're thrown around by a monster while touching a level trigger (for instance, the branches in forest caves).
- Fixed bioluminescent cave's hallucination effect never going fully away and made it treatable with haloperidol.
- Fixed bots treating radiation sickness too eagerly (leading to wasted antirad).
- Added missing platforms to abandoned outpost modules.
- Fixed non-interactable items being counted as owned in the store interface.
- Fixed husk's mouth tentacles rendering on top of the left hand. Also fixed a minor texture bleeding on the waist.
- Fixed possible desync when multiple players use the crew management interface simultaneously.
- Fixed a crash when no valid limb was found for an affliction. Probably only happened with characters that already had some limbs severed.
- Fixed non-multiplied damage to limbs effectively always being clamped to 100, which means that no attack could do more than 100 damage per hit unless there's some damage modifier defined on the target limb.
- Monsters now stop targeting characters that are far enough behind level geometry. Fixes them getting stuck while trying to reach targets that are not easily reachable.
- Fixed players getting prompted to download subs when the server has disabled file transfers.
- Fixed command-spawned characters not getting the "job" tag on their id cards.
- Fixed coilguns consuming ammo faster than they should when linked to multiple loaders.
- Fixed wiring interface labels overlapping when using a high text scale.
- Allow engine propellers to do damage inside the sub.
- Fixed new lights being displayed as off in the sub editor until you toggle the lighting.
- Fixed non-ruin artifacts sometimes spawning on top of the sub.
- Fixed terminal's welcome message getting cleared when using the test mode in the sub editor.
- Fixed fabricator displaying the "not enough room in the input inventory" error even if the items fit in the input inventory by stacking.
- Fixed signal check components being unable to output whitespace.
- Fixed inability to edit smoke detector's parameters in-game.
- Fixed smoke detectors outputting empty signals.
- Fixed "engineers are special" outpost event not giving a price discount.
- Fixed clients being unable to vote for subs they don't have.
- Fixed a bunch of non-suitable items (such as devices that can't be deattached) being displayed in the "extra cargo" menu in the server lobby.
- Fixed crashing if you try to press the server log button in the lobby when connection to the server has been lost.
- Fixed item disappearing from the character's hand when you combine it with an item in a container in a way that doesn't fully deplete/remove it.
- Fixed gaps in the "backwall pipes" sprite.
- Fixed dedicated servers restricting player count to 1 less than the MaxPlayer setting.
- Fixed Kastrull's drone airlock not flooding correctly.
- Replaced legacy small pumps with the new ones in Orca.
- Fixed monsters sometimes spawning very close (or even inside) the respawn shuttle.
- Fixed "attempted to set SoundRange to NaN" error when a reactor's maximum power output is 0.
- Fixed wall damage particles sometimes spawning at an incorrect position.
- Fixed black moloch doing only 62.5% of the structure damage compared to the regular moloch.
- Fixes to R-29: fixed top docking port's control circuit, adjustments to pre-placed supplies, adjusted discharge coil power consumption, minor visual fixes.
- Reduced the amount of clown gear in the "Praise the Honkmother" mission to fit everything in the crate.
- Fixed non-repeatable outpost events starting to repeat once all of them have been triggered.
- Fixed inconsistency in the way vertical velocity in/out signals are handled by the nav terminals. Previously "velocity_in" would interpret positive y as upwards, even though "velocity_y_out" outputs a negative value when going up. Now positive is always down (= corresponds with the "descent velocity" value displayed on the terminal).
- Fixed Hammerhead Spawns not targeting decoys.
- Fixed the abyss monsters not targeting "provocative" items, like flares, glowsticks, scooters etc.
- Fixed Hammerhead Matriarch constantly fleeing from divers. It's intentional that the matriarch avoids the divers, but not as much. Now they should flee briefly only when shot by the player, making it possible for the divers to reach it (#5449).
- Fixed camera shaking/vibrating when moving at high speed.
- Fixed monsters being able to attack through ruin walls.
- Fixed overlapping vending machine and light switch in CrewModule_02.
- Fixed respawn shuttle maintaining an incorrect position after getting dispatched.
- Fixed inventory tooltip not changing when the cursor is hovered on the slot and the condition of the item changes.
- Fixed waypoints not being able to find hulls that have been added since the sub was last saved in the sub editor, causing them to appear blue.
- Fixed resizable outpost hallway modules not having waypoints and thus causing navigation issues.
- Fixed water particle effects not showing up when water flows between certain rooms in Remora.
- Addressed the lag spikes occasionally caused by Spineling's spikes when they hit/get stuck to something.
- Fixed logbooks being empty in the wreck salvage missions.

Bots:
- Bots now warn when you are running low / out of oxygen or welding fuel tanks, turret ammunition, or reactor fuel.
- Bots no longer report dead monsters on the sonar.
- Disabled the dialogue lines about not finding any targets for the given order, since they don't really improve the feedback. Instead they can give a wrong impression that the bot is not following the order when they actually are.
- Bots no longer speak about not being able to reach the diving suit when they fail to get it because it was taken by someone else. They will target another suit like they used to.
- Bots don't extinguish fires when there's ballast flora in the hull.
- Bots only speak about getting attacked when attacked by players. Fixes security bots throwing ultimatums on other bots that accidentally damage them (e.g. while welding).
- Bots that operate an item (reactor/turret) now drop the empty items on the floor instead of placing them back to a container. This saves time and the empty items should be taken care of by the idle bots.
- Fixed bots not seeking more oxygen before the remaining oxygen level drops to zero when they already have diving gear equipped and when they are staying stationary, leading to suffocation when the bot is repairing/operating while already wearing the diving gear and running out of oxygen tanks.
- Fixed bots trying to swap the oxygen tank too early when they are outside of the sub, which in some cases might lead to bugs where they try to get back inside the submarine.
- Improved the feedback by adding dialogues for swapping the oxygen and for not being able to find more oxygen.
- Fixed bots trying to return the diving suit when it's not a reasonable thing to do, but when they actually don't need it.
- Fixed bots failing to swap an oxygen tank from a diving mask to a diving suit when both items are equipped.
- Fixed bots getting confused when they have a mask without a valid oxygen tank inside it and when there's not enough oxygen in the room to be without the mask.
- Bots now react faster in general to all enemies.
- Bots now automatically attack enemies outside of the main sub, if they have a weapon. While docked to an enemy outpost or submarine, the "fight intruders" order now acts as an offensive order to attack the enemies on the connected submarine/outpost.
- Fixed bots following the player when the player is controlling a monster.
- You can now escape from NPCs by going far enough from them while they are pursuing you.
- Fixed bots reacting to attackers that are outside of the submarine.
- Fixed the "reportrange" parameter not working when the character is attacked. In practice only has effect on NPCs.
- Fixed report icons being shown also for other teams instead of just one's own team.
- Bots now target the closest limb instead of the main collider when they aim with the turret. With small creatures, this should now make any difference. With long creatures, it allows the bots to target the extremities of the body instead of always shooting at the main body.
- Fixed non-security bots fleeing the enemy (in defensive combat state) even when they are ordered to fight intruders.
- Bots no longer automatically unequip weapons after combat if they are outside of a friendly submarine.
- Fixed bots having difficulties in leaving the ruins via gaps.
- Allow bots to use gaps also to exit the sub, but only when following a player character.
- Fixed bots always trying to reach the closest item even when it's unreachable.
- Make bots find items faster.
- Fixed bots sometimes continuing their movement (e.g. walking towards a wall) when they fail to find the diving gear they need to continue with the go to objective (e.g. follow).
- Fixed security officers standing idle next to the stunned target and doing nothing when they don't have handcuffs. Only happened while trying to arrest the target.
- Fixed multiple bots occasionally trying to operate the reactor at the same time.
- Fixed bots "stealing" stuff while cleaning up. Happened when the objective changed (= they decided or were ordered to do something else while cleaning up). Idle bots are no longer allowed to take items from purchased containers.
- Fixed bots running headlessly around while trying to find the container for items while following the clean up order. Now they should walk around instead and only run when the target container is found.
- Fixes and adjustments to security officer reactions for damage done by friendlies.
- Fixed bots sometimes yelling that they can't enter an airlock when the sub is docked.
- Fixed bots taking items from fabricators and deconstructors.
- Fixed bots saying "Can't reach target [name]".

Modding:
- Fixed custom loading screen tips not showing up if the vanilla content package is enabled.
- Fixed crashing when loading a save where a stack contains more items than the maximum stack size for the item/container.
- The hit impact of a monster's attack can now be adjusted with the new "submarineimpactmultiplier" defined in the attack block. Note that this is a multiplier to the actual impact, hence also the force applied on the attacking monster affects the final impact.
- Explosions now have three new parameters: ignorecover, onlyinside, and onlyoutside.
- Fixed crashing/disconnects when preloading content at the start of a round if random events contain character variants. In practice, mods that used character variants in random events occasionally prevented rounds from starting.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to play a music clip that isn't a valid ogg file or if the file is not found.
- Fixed crashing when trying to spawn a character variant with custom inventory contents.
- Renamed the ai parameter "Threshold" as "DamageThreshold".
- Replaced "spawndeep" with "abyss" spawn type (defined in random events).
- New parameters StayInAbyss and StayInsideLevel that define the area where the creature tries to keep inside while not attacking.
- The creature disable distance, which totally disables the creature, is now exposed in the character parameters. The distance for triggering simple physics, which disables all the limbs and keeps only the main collider updated, is half of this distance. Increased the default from 22 000 to 25 000 (pixels).
- New attack pattern: Circle (around the target). Used by the abyss creatures.
- The aim speed and accuracy of NPC characters can now be adjusted in the npc (spawn) definition. The Aim speed also affects melee attack speed.
- Fixed OnSevered status effects launching also on the limb that the severed limb was attached to.
- Added "bleedingnonstop" affliction, which is just the same as normal bleeding but it never wears off.
- Added and option to target the last matching limb instead of the first (StatusEffect.TargetType.Limb). Implemented targeting other limbs even when the status effect is triggered from the limb, which was previously only implemented for status effects that targeted character. See Endworm for an example.
- Fixed hidden limbs not being ignored in many cases where they should, which potentially could cause issues with some custom monsters.
- Added "bleedparticlemultiplier" parameter in character definition, which can be used to increase/decrease the general amount of bleeding for the character in question.
- Added an option to always ignore an ai target if it's not inside the same sub as the character.
- Attacks can now "blink" limbs when they attack (Endworm). Blinking is a generic way to rotate limbs so that they "animate" (see Watcher's eye).
- Added AITrigger that can be used to trigger an ai state using the status effects (See Charybdis).
- Turned IsTraitor into a property so it can be accessed by status effects.
- Changed husk affliction's type to "alieninfection" because using "huskinfection" as both the identifier and type makes it impossible to add custom husk infections and reference just the custom one in conditionals or statuseffects.
- Fixed affliction statuseffects targeting NearbyItems or NearbyCharacters causing a crash.
- Corpses don't spawn in wrecks that contain no waypoints/spawnpoints.
- Monster events don't spawn monsters in wrecks that don't contain enemy spawnpoints.
- Fixed afflictions caused by status effects being multiplied by deltatime even when setvalue="true". The only vanilla statuseffect affected by this was incremental stun, which would stun the player for 1 frame instead of 1 second, but this may have affected some mods as well.
- Fixed errors when trying to load a beacon station with no reactor.
- Fixed level editor crashing when it tries to place a wreck that contains linked subs in the level.
- Added "onlyplayertriggered" condition for status effects. Currently only implemented for OnDamaged.
- Fixed crashing if you try to create a decal with incorrect casing.
- Fixed affliction's periodic effects being unable to reference afflictions defined later in the affliction xml.
- Fixed crashing if you save a campaign with a large map and try to load it with map generation parameters where the map is smaller.
- Fixed explosions not damaging level walls if their structure damage is set to 0.
- Fixed inability to load more than 5 wires per connection even if the connection is set to allow more.
- Allow to define afflictions (types or identifiers) to trigger the OnDamaged status effects only from certain afflictions and not all that do the damage. If the afflictions property is not defined, no restrictions are used (works as it used to).

v0.12.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cave improvements:
- New cave types and improvements to cave sprites.
- New cave hazards: exploding mushrooms, gas vents that drain oxygen and fuel tanks, sharp crystals that inflict bleeding and lacerations, hallucination-inducing plants.
- Made the caves more narrow.
- Position caves and ruins closer to the main path so the players won't have to swim hundreds of meters just to get to the entrance.
- Completing a nest mission turns adjacent empty locations to "Explored".
- Monster spawns are delayed up to a certain limit when most of the human players are exploring a ruin, wreck or a cave.
- Show a sonar marker at the cave's entrance in nest missions.
- Added some nest-specific level objects.

Additions and changes:
- Implemented stacking small items.
- Decreased toolbelt capacity to 6 slots.
- Rebalanced level events to have a better difficulty curve.
- Further improvements and balancing to the way locations change to other types of locations.
- The owner of a duffel bag is shown when hovering the cursor over one.
- Increased vanilla drones' range to 400 m.
- Nerfed stunning. The effect is now incremental: for example, a few hits from a stun baton only slows the target down, but a full stun requires several hits.
- Allow laying on beds.
- Added mudraptor, thresher and crawler hatchlings.
- Removed vision obstructing effects from diving mask and diving suit.
- Added "quickstart" console command.
- Added "setfreecamspeed" console command.
- Zoom more slowly when holding Ctrl in freecam. The speed can be adjusted with the "camerasettings" command.
- Added "CauseSpeechImpediment" attribute to afflictions that stops huskaffliction from causing a speech impediment when set to false.
- Added "sendmessages" attribute to affliction prefabs. When set to false it prevents husk affliction from sending messages on the screen.
- Increased the steps in the aim assist slider to make it possible to set it more precisely (there's a big difference between 0% and 10%).
- Show a "waiting for the campaign to start" text for clients without campaign management permissions in the game mode panel when campaign is being set up.
- Disable all the non-campaign-related elements in the server lobby when a campaign or campaign setup is active.
- Added some diving suits to outpost modules.
- Made engine's propeller damage indicator in the sub editor match the damage radius.
- Invert nav terminal velocity_x output and applied engine force for flipped subs. This should make it so that the sub will go forward when the engine is in "forward" state, instead of going to the right which is the default forward direction.
- Made cabinets waterproof.
- Nav terminals display a warning then the autopilot detects an ice spire.
- Modified oxygen tank, welding fuel tank, underwater scooter and duffel bag densities (they don't sink or ascend as quickly as they used to).

- Made outpost reactors non-interactable for player team characters.
- Monsters can spawn at both sides of the level during PvP missions, as opposed to always spawning near the sub on the left.
- Disable trying to edit human heads in the character editor, because it would break.
- Monsters can now use doors for fleeing and they should be able to break doors that are in the way to the escape target. However, if the target they are fleeing from is in the same room, they still "panic" and just try to run away from the target.
- Previously the swimming speed of monsters was halved. Now it's clamped. This fixes slow monsters like husk swimming really slow inside the submarine, but it also affects the others.
- Added a diving knife in one of the security item sets, so that the security officers always have a lethal weapon and won't have to keep bashing the creatures with a stun baton.
- Added a medic crate for medical items that are bought from an outpost. Previously the medical items were spawned inside a chemical crate.
- Changed the sounds heard in psychosis depending on whether the character is inside or outside of a submarine.
- Husks can now operate doors and hatches. They can also climb ladders and break doors, which they can't open.

- Added "wikiimage_sub" command, which generates an isolated image of the currently loaded submarine.
- Renamed memory component's "signal_store" input as "lock_state".
- Added visual snap grid into submarine editor and "togglegrid" console command to toggle it.
- Relay's toggle input ignores "0" signals.
- Only allow attaching one wire to a reactor's power_out connection, because more leads to power issues.
- Made motion sensor's IgnoreDead, Offset and Target properties editable in-game.
- Entering the sub while docked to an outpost doesn't make the music switch from an outpost track to a normal one.
- Restricted pet name tag to 32 characters.
- Instead of a static starting wallet of 2500 marks, the players get 8500 minus the price of the starting sub.
- Replaced existing skill progression feedback with skill increase popups.
- Added new music track, "Extraterrestrial Broadcast".
- Fruits now float on water.
- Added a HSV color picker in sub editor that can be accessed by clicking the small color preview rectangle in the property editor.
- Ctrl+V keybind in sub editor now pastes on the position of your cursor instead of at the center of the screen.
- Holding Alt and dragging the mouse now brings up a measuring tape in sub editor.
- Added "bindkey", "unbindkey" and "savebinds" console commands that can be used to assign console commands to keys.
- Disabled hotbar slot keybinds when holding the Windows Key on Linux.

- Added store-specific price variance: every store has its own small price factor that affects all item prices.
- Hammerhead spawns are no longer afraid of being shot with sub's turrets. They also try to get in more aggressively.
- Readjusted the flame particle positions on the welding tool and the plasma cutter.
- Lowered the electrical skill required for wiring oxygen tank shelves and diving suit lockers.

- Added glowsticks.
- Added an option to change the text scale.

Bots:
- Bots report ballast flora when they see it.
- Bots operating turrets now report what they see. They also call "firing" a bit less frequently.
- Bots using a coilgun/railgun report which kind of enemies they see.
- Fixed medics sometimes not letting go of the character they're treating after running out of medical items.
- Fixed medics not ignoring targets that they can't heal, because they don't have the items for it, which caused the medics to be trapped in a looping behavior.
- Outpost NPCs can arrest or kill players who try to cause leaks in the outpost.
- Changes to how the bots operate repair tools, so that they won't fail so easily when the water forces kick in.
- Bots (only the crew) now tolerate a bit more damage from repair tools before reacting.
- Bots should now properly respect ignored targets also when they are already targeting the item when you tell them to ignore it.
- Fixed bots not equipping diving gear when the oxygen level is low and there is no leaks/water in the hull, causing them to suffocate.
- Fixed bots "forgetting" autonomous operate (operate reactor or steer) orders if the objectives happen to fail.
- Fixed bots sometimes incorrectly abandoning a movement objective, when the path requires a diving gear.

- AI Pathing: Fixed a huge penalty given to stairs causing characters to choose weird paths to avoid stairs.
- Fixed bots running towards a door when they can't find a path while following a target, which was not the intended behavior. The bots should now stop moving and wait in place instead.
- Fixed docking port not always being properly connected to a door, causing a missing link between the waypoints and making it impossible for the bots to access the port on some subs. The accepted distance is now relative to the docking port's sprite's height so that all doors inside the sprite should be treated as close enough. Additionally you can manually link a door to a docking port in the sub editor.
- Fixed bots thinking that they need a diving suit to access certain drones/airlocks on subs that the creator haven't manually removed the waypoints on the ladders outside the airlock door. There's no need to remove those waypoints anymore, although it shouldn't matter if you do.
- Bots should now always heal players when ordered to. They still use a threshold for targeting other bots, but it's now slightly higher (90 instead of 85). This only applies when the bots are ordered, not when they act on their own.
- Bots now speak about not having any targets after a 3 sec delay. Fixes bots sometimes complaining that there's no targets even when there are.
- Fixed bots not properly ignoring non-interactable containers.
- Fixed bots dropping off from ladders when they first try to go up using a ladder and then down using another ladder right next to the first ladder. Happened especially in Kastrull.
- Fixed bots taking items from mission cargo containers (e.g. clean up or rescue).
- Fixed bots not properly checking the line of sight while trying to extinguish fires.
- Bots don't anymore drop empty oxygen tanks in the sea, if they have room in the inventory.
- Bots should now take oxygen tanks with less than 80% either to an oxygen generator or an oxygen tank shelf. Secondary places for non-empty tanks are the diving and the supply cabinets.
- Bots should now take battery cells with less than 80% to a battery or charging dock (added "batterycellrecharger" tag for these items).
- Bots don't yell anymore that they need more oxygen when they are running out of oxygen and have a non-empty oxygen tank(s) in their inventory.
- Fixed bots not respecting the Wait order inside ruins.
- Bots now shoot ice spires when the sub is moving towards them or if they are very close to the turret.
- Bots steering the sub now report ice spires they spot on the sonar.
- Bots now switch batteries when operating scooters. They also unequip the scooter if they run out of batteries, instead of just swimming with it.
- Bots now know how to switch batteries to the stun baton.
- Bots don't drop empty welding tanks or ammunition in the sea anymore, if they have room in the inventory.
- Fixed bots not shooting through turrets that block the line of sight.

- Added "needsair" attribute to husk affliction, when set to true it disables low oxygen resistance granted by husk affliction.
- Fixed crashing when a StatusEffect targets a removed limb.
- Fixed conditional "And" comparisons not always working correctly when targeting items (the conditional needed to be true on the item and all it's components).
- Added support for overriding textures on character variants. Only supports overriding the entire texture, not separate textures per limb.
- Added support for overriding animations on character variants.
- Added min and max conditions (in percentages) for preferred containers.
- Added support for randomized deconstruction output: Deconstruct elements now support "chooserandom" and "amount" attributes, Item elements support "commonness" attribute.
- Added ClearTagAction that removes the specified tag from the event.
- Added CheckAfflictionAction that can be used to check if a character has an affliction.
- Added "InWater" property to characters.
- Planter component now triggers "OnPicked" status effects when interacted with.
- Allow items with a kinematic physics body to have a connection panel component.
- Fixed HasStatusTag conditionals only checking the first active status effect.
- Fixed multiple characters spawning when a character infected with multiple different types of husk afflictions dies.

- Fixed desync when entering a new level when there's a logbook with a very long message in the sub or in someone's inventory in the multiplayer campaign.
- Fixed very large numbers of submarines in the "Submarines/Downloaded/" folder causing excessive loading times, freezes and high memory usage.
- Delete submarines from Submarines/Downloaded when launching the game and hide downloaded subs from menus. The folder is now essentially a temporary folder for storing a server's submarines during a game session, not a place for persistent storage.

v0.11.0.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment overhaul:
- Remade textures.
- Branching level paths.
- More varied level layouts.
- Added small explorable caves alongside the main path.
- Made the floating ice chunks destructible.
- The areas outside the traversable path are solid instead of hollow, so it's no longer possible for monsters to spawn "outside the level" or for the sub to get lost at the wrong side of the level walls.
- Ice spires: tall, protrusions that cut holes in the submarine if you hit them.
- Piezo crystals: environmental objects that drain power from the submarine when you get too close to them.
- The biomes further on the campaign map are deeper down in the ocean, meaning that crush depth starts higher up in the level. The biomes near the end of the map require hull upgrades to traverse safely.
- Improved resource (minerals and plants) spawning: resources now spawn in clusters which can contain multiple instances of the same resource.
- Made thermal artifacts a bit more manageable: they now start a fires periodically, not continuously.

New missions:
- Nest missions where you need to enter a cave to destroy a monster nest.
- Beacon missions where you have to repair and power up a "beacon station".
- Mineral collection missions where you have to locate and mine a mineral cluster.

Additions and changes:
- Added ballast flora, a plant-like organism that can infect the submarine and leech power from junction boxes and batteries. A ballast flora infection may be contracted by passing through a colony of ballast flora spores (which are faintly visible on the sonar).
- Added a new monster, "Spineling".
- Adjustments and balancing to the way locations change to other types of locations: habitation now spreads faster as the player explores the campaign map further.
- Added new military outpost music track.
- Submarine hull upgrades increase the submarine's tolerance to pressure, allowing it to dive deeper without getting crushed by pressure.
- Deep Diver subs can dive 20% deeper than other subs without getting crushed.
- Added mineral scanning functionality for sonars: enabled by default for handheld sonars, can be enabled for other sonar devices in the Sub Editor with Sonar component's "HasMineralScanner" property
- Added concatenation component (a signal component that joins two inputs together).
- Added a ready check that can be used to check if everyone is ready to depart from an outpost in multiplayer.
- Added "ignore" order that can be used to prevent bots from using/repairing/taking specific items or devices.
- Discharge coil's range can be visualized by holding space while one is selected in the sub editor.
- Level difficulty affects the way outpost events are chosen (the more difficult events don't occur until later in the campaign).
- Non-wiring-related items become transparent in the sub editor's wiring mode.
- Improved turret range visualization in the sub editor.
- Made skill checks in outpost events probability-based: a low skill doesn't mean you'll always fail, just that you're less likely to succeed.
- Reworked bonethresher's behavior and attacks. Tigerthreshers now protect Bonethreshers with a low priority. Minor tweaks to the ragdolls and animations.
- Added water percentage output to water detector.
- Reduced scrap spawn rates in wrecks.
- Removed the explosive cargo mission variant where one of the explosives spontaneously explodes.
- Split combat missions into a separate game mode.

- Fixed watcher's gaze causing severe effects inside the submarine.
- UI: Moved the navigation controls to the right side of the sonar view and readjusted the layout.
- Moved the cleanup order to the last in the maintenance category.
- Flagged certain parts of the nose and tail of the vanilla submarines as non-targetable, because the monsters tended to go inside the nose/tail parts too often.
- Increased the sound ranges for Tigerthresher, Leucocyte, Terminal cell, Mudraptor, and Crawler (should make them more audible).
- Crawlers, Tigerthershers, and Spinelings now avoid being killed by the engine (more or less).
- Adjusted the avoiding behavior for monsters.

Bots:
- Bots don't anymore clean up other diving suits when they have one equipped already.
- Bots don't anymore take diving suits off inside outposts (unless they have to).
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when their body is near the floor.
- Fixed bots equipping diving gear too eagerly when the oxygen level drops in the room.
- Fixed all npcs and bots using the "Passive" idle behavior. Changed the guard idling so that they now more and prefer longer distances. Also other crew members should now move slightly more than previously.
- Increase combat priority of some tools so that the bots prefer those to toy hammer.
- More descriptive bot dialog when they can't find items they're looking for.
- Diving suits the bots have dropped in an outpost are automatically moved to the cargo bay when departing from the outpost.
- Outpost security allows "stealing" diving masks and suits if the outpost is flooding.
- Bots keep more distance to the player while following underwater and outside the sub.
- Fixed a rare crash in AIObjectiveIdle.Wander method.

- Fixed outpost NPCs sometimes "cleaning up" the spawned toolbox in the event "clownrelations1".
- Fixed bots loading more rods to the reactor when the load is too high, even if the current amount of fuel is already enough to maximize the output.

Modding:
- Added "IgnoreWhileInside" and "IgnoreWhileOutside" parameters on character targeting parameters.
- Added ranged projectile attacks for monsters. See Spineling for an example. Note that there are five different rotation modes for the projectile aiming: Fixed, Target, Limb, MainLimb, and Collider.
- Added a "sweep attack", which makes the creature sinuate while closing to the target instead of moving straight towards it. Used on Spineling.
- Added limb hiding (permanent or temporary) with status effects. Used on Spineling.
- Added limb breaking with status effects.
- Allow characters to move full speed after attacking, when the cooldown is active. The property is found in the attack definition.
- Allow to use the idle behavior (wandering) after attacking, during the cooldown.
- Added "OnlyOutside" and "OnlyInside" attributes for status effects. Affects only the targets of the effect.
- Fixed particle's "LoopAnim" property doing nothing.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed occasional "missing entity" errors caused by the server failing to write an ID card's data in a network message.
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused power to desync in multiplayer: when connecting the second end of a wire to a device other than a junction box, the server would sometimes not register the wire as being connected.
- Fixed previous messages disappearing from terminals and logbooks when transitioning to a new level in the campaign.
- Fixed sprite depths in dockingmodule 2, should prevent z-fighting.
- Fixed crashing when a bot abandons AIObjectiveCombat due to the target being in a different sub (e.g. if a character the outpost security is chasing moves from the outpost to the sub).
- Fixed undocking enabling all disabled nodes instead of just those that were connected to the docking port in question.
- Fixed EventManager to always choosing the same events from identical event sets in a given level. Meaning that if a level for example had 3 monster spawns that spawn either a crawler or a mudraptor, and the first event spawned a crawler, the rest would as well. In practice this lead to there being less variation in monster spawns than intended.
- Kastrull: Added more waypoints around the drone so that bots know how to get around it when it's docked to the main sub. Also fixed the airlock waypoints not being linked to the doors, causing the bots not being able to operate them.
- Fixed Health Scanner HUD showing a disguised character's true identity.
- Fixed health interface showing the original face and occupation of disguised characters.

- Fixed atan component output being inconsistent: the output was only correct if the y input was received after the x input during the same frame.
- Fixed crashing if a character's hands get severed while repairing something.
- Fixed stored non-shadow-casting lights being subtracted from the shadow-casting light count in the sub editor.
- Fixed autocalculated submarine price not being saved if the player doesn't touch the price field in the sub editor's save dialog.
- Fixed OnContained/OnNotContained StatusEffects not running if the itemcomponent is not active. In practice prevented oxygenite shards from supplying power until someone moves them. May have caused some other issues as well.

- Fixed reputation loss when "stealing" fire extinguishers from outposts when there's a fire.
- Fixed periscopes outputting rotation values incorrectly when connected to something else than a turret (e.g. camera).
- Fixed resetting game settings reloading content packages, causing items to disappear if the settings are reset when a round is running.
- Fixed pet's hunger/happiness values and inventories not getting saved between rounds.
- Fixed pet name tags disappearing client-side between rounds.

- Fixed "hide offensive server names" tickbox working the wrong way around in the server browser.
- Fixed console errors when setting an engine's max force to 0.
- Fixed in ability to damage huskified crew members if friendly fire is disabled.
- Fixed prototype steam cannon particles going through walls.
- Fixed "engineers are special" outpost event not giving XP when successfully helping the NPC.
- Fixed "propaganda" and "clown outbreak" outpost events not triggering.
- Fixed wires not appearing in some item assemblies placed in the sub editor until the sub is saved.
- Fixed decorative sprites being positioned incorrectly on mirrored items (such as pumps and fabricators).
- Fixed rotation limits being incorrect on turrets that have been mirrored before saving the sub.
- Fixed crashing when a bot is left to idle inside ruins.
- Fixed deconstructing an SMG magazine causing an SMG round to drop on the ground.
- Fixed empty SMG magazines not deconstructing to plastic.

- Fixed the latching behavior on Crawlers.
- Fixed latched creatures not releasing the sub when the submarine moves fast enough (defined in the latching behavior definition).
- Fixed outpost events sometimes triggering on dead/unconscious players.
- Fixed wifi component accepting input from chat regardless of the "link to chat" setting (the setting only determined if the component outputs the messages to the chat of the player holding the item, making it only useful for headsets).
- Fixed an issue that caused freezes when opening the server browser.
- Fixed "there is not enough room in the input inventory" error when placing a legacy medical fabricator in the sub editor.
- Fixed picking up a captain's pipe selecting it, preventing aiming until the item is deselected.

- Fixed inability to play the campaign from the same local network when hosting with the dedicated server.
- Fixed crashing when clicking "spectate" in the server lobby after connection has been lost.
- Fixed occasional "too much data in network event" error messages.
- Fixed clients assigning different initial location reputations than the server, causing the round summary to display random reputation loss/gain when leaving the first outpost.
- Fixed "No AI Target" property not working properly.
- Fixed a rare crash when crawlers latch to a submarine.
- Fixed the vanilla submarines not always having any wrenches, which causes the bots not being able to fix mechanical items if they don't have a wrench in their inventory. Also made sure that all engineers have a wrench when they spawn.
- Fixed recovering and repairing a shuttle not removing the wall damage client-side.
- Fixed crashing when a hull smaller than 16x16px is painted or becomes dirty.
- Fixed characters not being visible when viewing an area far away from the player with a drone in multiplayer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.10.6.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adjusted pets' item production rates and hunger/happiness thresholds.
- Fixed inability to pick up chitin chunks.
- Fixed event manager considering pets to be enemies, leading to monster spawns being delayed or disabled altogether when there are pets inside the sub.
- Fixed bots having difficulties in entering/exiting the airlocks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.10.6.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added sounds for pets.
- Most fruits can be fed to pets.
- Increased the time it takes for pets to get hungry.
- Decreased pets' item production rate.
- The number of monsters now increases the event intensity more than previously, which should spawn monsters less frequently.
- Added some unarmored mudraptors to low-difficulty levels.
- Fixed crashing when a character takes damage from something else than another character attacking them (e.g. volcanoes).
- Fixed some steering issues where bots would return to the last waypoint instead of continuing with their current path when they should.
- Fixed occasional "velocity invalid" error messages when a character gets hit by a very fast projectile (e.g. coilgun bolt).
- Fixed severed tiger thresher heads doing the "death wiggle" animation.
- Fixed water flow sounds not disappearing over time.
- Fixed throwing an item that has no status effects (such as a flare) causing a crash.
- Fixed chitin helmet spawning in armory cabinets.
- Fixed event intensity going down immediately when the situation gets less intense instead of gradually returning to normal. Should make it happen less that more monsters are spawned soon after the player survives the previous wave of monsters.
- Fixed monsters using the Escape state when they should use the Flee state.
- Fixed Threshers not dying after being beheaded.
- Fixed heads or other extruding limbs being severed also when their root body takes damage.
- Fixed bots trying to get inside outposts (from outside) that they can't and shouldn't be able to enter to.
- Fixed very small creatures getting stuck on waypoints.
- Test changing the assignment logic for maintenance/operate orders: if the player doesn't specify the target character, use the bot who already is following the same order. The intention is to make it easier to change the target item of the order. The draw back is that ordering multiple bots to man the turrets now requires an extra step: specify the target character.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed yet another cause for "missing entity" errors. Occasionally happened in monster missions when a monster happened to get assigned the same ID as an item in a player's inventory.

- Fixed extinguish fires not working with extinguish fire orders if the room has not enough oxygen.
- Fixed the user set state of the crew list not being respected; autohiding/showing shouldn't change the state set by the player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.10.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes and additions:
- Added gardening: four different growable plants that produce specialed fruits which can be crafted into different items, or just thrown about and splattered on the hulls of the sub.

- User's helm skill affects engine output.
- The game is paused when the campaign map is open in the single player campaign.

- Added "fuel_out" output to reactors.
- Added "set_light" connection to turrets.
- Made stun gun darts craftable from any type of wire.

- Made togglehud command usable in the sub editor for nicer screenshots.

- Fixed Unsubscribe button sometimes failing to delete mod content.
- Fixed a crash when attempting to modify the currently selected core package when other core packages aren't available.
- Fixed a modding-related crash at startup.
- Increased the "SeverLimbsProbability" cap (for items) from 1 to 10. The value is multiplied together with the joint setting "SeveranceProbabilityModifier", and limiting the value to 1 makes it impossible to boost the probability of some weapons/attacks.
- Fixed negative rotation speeds not working on decorative sprites.
- Fixed ItemPrefabs loading after AfflictionPrefabs.
- Previous enabled mods are restored when leaving a server.
- Added support for "periodic effects" (effects that execute every x seconds) to Afflictions. See the new "nausea" affliction for a usage example.

AI improvements:
- Using the fire extinguisher when there is a fire is no longer considered stealing by the NPCs.
- NPCs now spawn an oxygen tank if they can't find any. They don't spawn diving gear though.
- NPC guards now spawn more handcuffs if they don't have any and are trying to arrest a target.
- NPCs now spawn a welding fuel tank, if they can't find any. They don't spawn welding tools.

- Bots don't try to move while grabbed by a friendly character.
- Bots now detect and ignore leaks that other bots are targeting.
- Bots don't anymore try to decontain diving suits when the path to the cabinets is flooding.
- All crew members now try to keep the reactor running, unless the player orders someone to shut if down or turns it off manually.
- Bots shouldn't anymore try to operate items that other bots are targeting (previously they used to walk next to the device and only then continue).
- Removed the following autonomous objectives from medic and the security officer: fix leaks, repair systems, and pump water.
- Bots should now give a high priority on items that they are currently repairing, no matter if the decision to repair that item was made by them or the player controlling the character.
- Bots that operate/fix should now wait a few seconds before heading on their business (previously only in idle state). They are not allowed to wait in some circumstances, like when they are underwater or when there's a threat around.

Additions and changes:
- Added 2 new moloch variants: Black Moloch and Moloch Pupa.
- Reworked Moloch.
- Overhauled level layouts and events (longer and more difficult levels).
- Added two new afflictions: medical items and poisons cause organ damage instead of internal damage and explosions cause deep tissue injuries. Both are functionally identical to internal damage, and treated with the same items.
- Added DXT5 texture compression to reduce memory consumption. Slightly increases loading times; if you're not short on memory, you may want to disable the compression from the game settings.
- Added partial dismemberment for live creatures. Currently enabled only for non-humanoids. (Dismembering dead bodies was already in the game).

- Placed down wires can now be re-equipped in the sub editor by double clicking a loose end.
- Added charging docks to Remora.
- Adjusted how pixel sizes are converted to meters (which are used to display the submarine's dimensions and distances on the navigation terminal). Previously 100 pixels corresponded to 1 meter, now it's 80px -> 1m, making the human characters about 1.75m tall.

- The "shut down" reactor order now allows the bot to continue doing other things after powering off the reactor, instead of just standing next to the reactor.
- Removed the "initiative" skill -> all bots should now react better when there's something to do. Note: this doesn't mean that they always react on everything. It's just the end of individualism. At least for now.
- Reduced the physical forces applied on characters when they are hit by melee weapons, harpoons, or frag grenades. Adjusted stun for crowbar and harpoon.
- Disabled retreat/escape behavior for the bots when they take damage from items or explosions. They still escape/fight back when attacked by other characters.
- Refactor the medic priority calculations/logic: Bots should never treat others autonomously, unless they are medics or ordered to rescue. Bots should always give a high priority for treating themselves, unless there's a medic on board.
- Adjusted the flipping logic of non-humanoids to make them flip less frequently.
- Monsters won't anymore target nasonov artifact unless it is inside the player submarine or in the player inventory.

- Creatures can now be set to disrupt sonar.
- Player attacks can now also use the conditionals (i.e. when player is controlling a character). Previously only the AI used the conditionals.

- Made flamers fire proof to prevents the flames from blowing up the fuel tank inside it.
- Don't allow harpoons to stick to very small limbs (such as mudraptor's "mouth tentacles"), because it lead to physics glitches.
- Fixed the husk infection crashing when turning the character, if either the non-husk or the husked variation has no inventory defined.
- Fixed characters getting weapon XP after using a turret, until someone else operates the same turret.
- Fixed characters being able to crouch when their pose is controlled by a controller (e.g. periscope, modded chair).
- Fixed bots being unable to aim correctly when operating a turret in another submarine (such as a remotely controlled coilgun in a shuttle).
- Fixed bots sometimes taking too much time to interrupt their current objective when the room they're in floods, causing them to get crushed by pressure.
- Fixed bots sometimes letting go of ladders too soon, preventing them from reaching certain areas (such as the upper platform in Berilia's cargo bay).
- Fixed multiple bots sometimes trying to treat the same person.

- Don't allow detaching signal components when rewiring is disabled or the item's connection panel is locked.
- Fixed misaligned hull next to Wreck1's airlock.
- Fixed "attempting to remove an already removed item" errors when mass-deleting items. Happened because removing items a wire is connected to removes the orphaned wires automatically.
- Fixed multi-part subs (example case: The Aeche III) getting teleported to oblivion when flipped.
- Fixes to bots getting stuck or killed for no apparent reason when the player is very far from them, due to the bots switching to a "simple physics mode" which prevents them from doing certain kinds of interactions.

- Fixed very small limbs (mudraptor's mouth tentacles, husk appendages) launching off at a very high velocity, leading to glitchy physics behavior, when hit by a non-raycast projectile or an explosion.
- Allow subs to be saved to subdirectories of the "Submarines" folder (e.g. "Submarines/Downloaded").
- Fixed a couple of waypoints in Berilia that prevented bots from using the ladders.
- Fixed Husked Crawler bleeding red blood.
- Fixed the priority of the operate order being 69 when it should be 70, which sometimes caused bots to get stuck between two objectives (like repairing or fixing leaks).
- Fixed enemies always using the priority defined for "room" when they should use the priority for "sonar".
- Fixed monsters not being able to drop down from platforms/hatches etc. In practice they still have difficulties in getting down from the hatches when they don't swim because they are so big.
- Fixed bots ignoring themselves as a target when they are rescuing others.
- Fixed numerous issues in the monster behavior when simple physics is enabled. e.g. Ignoring targets or not being able to attack or eat them.
- Fixed hitting damage modifiers emitting a ridiculous amount of particles.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed bots being unable to fire turrets due to the visibility raycast hitting the turret's collider.
- Fixed submarine's version number resetting to 0.0.0.0 when saving in the sub editor (didn't affect the actual saved sub file, only the in-game metadata that got fixed by restarting the game - so there's no need to do anything to fix the sub files you saved with the previous version).
- Fixed server list occasionally crashing when trying to filter based on game mode.
- Fixed an issue in multiplayer campaign that occasionally caused clients to get kicked with a "missing entity" error message.
- Fixed clients occasionally crashing when joining a server mid-round. Happened when the client tried to execute the attack of a monster that has already despawned server-side.
- Fixed local changes an user has made to a mod getting overwritten when the item gets autoupdated.
- Changed the hotkey to toggle the entity list in the sub editor from Q to the "toggle inventory" keybind to make it a little more user-friendly on AZERTY keyboards.
- Fixed corpses in wrecks being considered dead members of the crew in SteamAchievementManager, preventing "lone sailor" from unlocking and making it possible to unlock "last man standing" with just one character.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.7.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing when attempting to publish Workshop items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI/UX improvements:
- Graphical and functional overhaul of all user interfaces.
- Cursor changes according to what it's hovered on (hand icon when on a button, caret icon when on a textbox, etc).
- New loading screen.
- Better feedback on shooting.
- Double clicking on an item moves it to the equipped inventory (e.g. ammo to the equipped weapon).
- Periscopes can be deselected by pressing esc.
- Fabricators can pull ingredients directly from the user's inventory without having to place them in the fabricator's input slots.
- Lock the on/off switch in the pump interface when the state is controlled by signals, same with the engine slider.
- 1 second cooldown before doors can be opened/closed after someone else has opened/closed them. Makes it less likely for doors to be opened/closed accidentally when multiple people are trying to use them at the same time.
- Show a warning if trying to start a campaign for the first time without playing the tutorials.
- Diving suits and fire extinguishers are not automatically picked up from the lockers/brackets when clicking on them to make it less likely to accidentally pick them up. Instead, clicking on them opens the inventory of the container, the same way when interacting with e.g. a steel cabinet.
- Subinventories (= inventories inside items, toolboxes for example) open/close faster and cannot be interacted with until fully open.
- Contents of toolboxes and crates are shown in the tooltip when hovering the cursor over the slot.
- In-game message boxes (mission/traitor notifications) close automatically after 15 seconds if not interacted with.
- Right-clicking in the sub editor opens a context menu that can be used to remove, cut, copy and paste entities (making it possible to remove them when using a keyboard that doesn't have a delete key).
- Hide cursor when aiming with a turret or a ranged weapon.
- Hide inventory when operating a turret.
- Added filtering to sprite and particle editors.
- Added a "Decorative" category to the submarine editor.
- Made docking indicators more visible on the sonar.
- Show mic input level also when Push-to-Talk mode is selected to make it easier to adjust the level without having to switch the mode to Voice Activity.
- Pressing the up arrow brings up previously sent chat messages, making it easier to resend them.
- The filter in the sub editor only searches from the currently selected category.

Optimizations:
- Major physics optimization. Most importantly, the physics are now multithreaded, making the game perform much better when there are large numbers of characters active.
- Item optimizations. Items that don't currently have any components active are not updated, which significantly improves the performance especially in large subs with lots of items.
- More aggressive character culling (characters stop being rendered as soon as they exit the camera view).
- Dead bodies despawn after a few minutes (or when the character respawns in multiplayer). The despawning character's items are placed in a duffel bag and dropped near the body. Prevents performance issues when lots of bodies start to accumulate in the submarine.
- Preload necessary monster assets at the start of the round to prevent lag spikes when a monster spawns.
- Fixed serious performance issues when creatures are on the borders of the sub (some issues still remain).
- Improved the performance of human AI (bots).

Additions and changes:
- Added Korean translation.
- Added an improved version of Typhon.
- Reworked Berilia.
- New shuttle, "Hemulen".
- Merged Selkie and Bunyip into a new, improved shuttle (just called Selkie now).
- Increased level sizes.
- Rebalanced monster spawns.
- Balanced skill levels and skill gains.
- Skill gain values are now moddable (see Content/SkillSettings.xml).
- Added a few new artifact missions.
- The job gear variants are not just visually different versions of the same item, but completely separate items. The job variants now allow the players to choose what kind of gear they want to spawn with, not just the look of the uniform.
- Attachable items and wire nodes can now be freely placed around the character instead of always being placed at the position of the character. When attaching items/wires, there's a placement grid that makes it much easier to neatly attach/wire things mid-round.
- The submarines now get automatically outfitted with a semi-random selection of supplies when starting a campaign. The items that have been manually placed in the submarine editor are kept as-is.
- Split internal damage into multiple subtypes: blunt force trauma, lacerations and bite wounds. The new afflictions are functionally identical to the default internal damage affliction, but can be used to identify the source of the injuries.
- Humans are more resistant to gunshot wounds, lacerations and blunt force trauma than monsters. The intention is to allow making weapons more effective towards monsters without making killing your crewmates with them too easy.
- Added a "terminal" item that can be used to send and display textual signals. Could be used for things such as terminals that send commands to devices or display some data received from devices.
- Added muzzle flashes to small firearms.
- Added a crosshair when aiming with small firearms. The crosshair also indicates the spread of the weapon.
- Increased the skill requirements to operate the reactor.
- New background music for editors.
- Characters with an insufficient electrical engineering skill may get electrocuted when rewiring powered devices.
- Added holes in the level walls next to the outpost at the end of the level, so the player doesn't have to backtrack through most of the level if they approach the outpost from the wrong side of the level wall.
- Added heavy water currents at the sides of the level to make it more obvious that you're not supposed to go that way.
- Added subtle chromatic aberration & blur when suffering from heavy bloodloss.
- Nerfed hull damage from plasma cutter and welding tool explosions.
- Removed repair thresholds from items; any device that's not in perfect condition can now be repaired.
- Rebalanced medical items: stat-boosting effects last much longer.
- Modified vigor buffs from steroids and hyperzine to be intantaneous instead of delayed.
- Tweaked opiates. They now do less overdose damage, produce a lower addiction for skilled users, but produce a serious addiction for unskilled users.
- Bandages now have 3 uses.
- Removed oxygenite shards as a product of deconstructing liquid oxygenite to prevent production loops.
- Screwdrivers can be used as shivs!
- Fuel rods now always return their steel on deconstruction.
- Constructing fuel rods now requires lead.
- Mouse button names are now translated.
- Improved tiger thresher texture and lights.
- Replaced the legacy ladder, stair and docking port sprites.
- New alarm buzzer sprite that actually looks like an alarm buzzer.
- New (smaller) small pump sprite.
- Decreased the range and brightness of the "halo" around the players.
- Exposed pump's MaxFlow parameter in the sub editor.
- Added a lot more oomph to nuclear explosions.
- Added damage particle effects that are rendered on top of the characters (also under water).
- Split internal damage into categories: gunshot wound, blunt trauma, lacerations, monster bites, and internal damage.
- Gunshot wound is no longer a bleeding affliction.
- Humans are more resistant to damage caused by weapons (means we can increase the damage on monsters without making the weapons too lethal on humans)
- Added damage protections on some clothes.
- Major SMG buff: larger magazine, less spread, more damage, but slightly lower fire rate.
- Minor Shotgun buff: more damage and stun.
- Slightly decreased the stun effect from revolver ammunition.
- Modding: Removed all texture paths from limbs where they are not required. Fixes issues when trying to create a copy with a custom texture based on an existing character. Note that the "Copy Character" functionality does not automatically replace texture paths that have been defined in limbs, because that could lead into issues. If there are texture paths in the limbs, you'll have to handle it manually. The texture paths defined in limbs are limb specific overrides to the common path defined in the ragdoll's properties.
- Use "weldingequipment" tag instead of "weldingtool" identifier when seeking the equipment for fixing the leaks to enable support for custom welding equipment.
- Use "cuttingequipment" tag instead of "plasmacutter" identifier as required items for collecting minerals to enable support for custom cutting equipment.
- Artifact mission markers are shown on the sonar even after the artifact is on board to make it harder to lose the artifact.
- Made monster mission markers more imprecise.
- Made the "name contains illegal symbols" error message more descriptive (with instructions to change the name to something else).
- CPR damage can be modded by editing the affliction xml.
- A warning when attempting to start a campaign that was saved with different mods than the ones that are currently active.
- Switched from .NET Framework 4.5/Mono to .NET Core 3.0:
	- Improves general stability, especially on macOS and Linux.
	- Lowers number of dependencies, simplifying the installation process.
	- Introduces features that will translate into further stability and performance improvements in the future.
- Switched from MP4 to WebM to minimize bloat and dependencies on patented tech.
- Cap the framerate to 200 FPS when VSync is off to prevent overloading the GPU. The cap can be adjusted by changing the "framelimit" attribute in config_player.xml.
- Wifi components in the respawn shuttle can't communicate with components in other submarines/shuttles.
- Power consumption of damaged devices doesn't increase as much anymore.
- Made tonic liquid purchasable.
- Added combat priorities to alien weapons to allow bots to use them.
- Improved name tag hiding.
- Give job items to humans spawned with the "spawn" command.
- Slightly increased the view range of the coilguns and railguns.
- Continue playing the main menu and editor music from the previous position instead of restarting when switching between screens.
- Marked "editsubs" a cheat command (so you can't just switch to the sub editor, spawn whatever you need and go back to the game without enabling cheats).

AI:
- Bots can now undock the sub.
- Humanoids now use the "group" property like non-humanoids. This allows non-humanoid creatures to be treated as friendly/neutral subjects by the bots.
- Replaced the generic "cannot reach target" messages with context-specific and more descriptive messages.
- Bots now take the other bots into account when they evaluate the importance of the tasks. Fixes multiple bots going to fix the same leaks or repair the same items.
- Bots should now abandon the combat objective only when not fleeing from an enemy. If they fail to flee from an enemy, they will fight (or avoid) instead.
- Fixed bots loading the turrets only with the default ammunition.
- Fixed multiple bots trying to navigate the submarine at the same time.
- Fixed pathfinding applying 10x more penalty on vertical distance when the host is outside (should only apply inside).
- Fixed bots starting the path from obstructed waypoints or waypoints that are inside when they are outside or vice versa.
- Fixed issues when bots are trying to enter the airlock from outside.
- Fixed bots getting stuck in the combat mode (with 100 priority) when they try to retreat to a target that cannot be reached.
- Fixed two-handed items like ammoboxes not being visible when the bots carry them.
- Fixed issues when the bots try to equip items or contain them inside other items.
- Fixed bots sometimes going to repair leaks/fix things without a mask or a suit.
- Fixed bots being unable to put diving suits into lockers when there already is a diving suit in the targeted container. Instead of dropping it on the ground, the bots now try to find a new place for the suit before abandoning the objective.
- Fixed bots seeking paths through doors when they have a crowbar/wrench equipped.
- Fixed bots sometimes being unable to put off fires and dying while trying to do it (because of a failing raycast).
- Fixed bots not shooting hostile submarines.

Monsters:
- New behaviors: avoiding, passive-aggressive, and aggressive.
- Adjusted Bonethresher, added a berserker attack when the creature is low in health.
- Revised Matriarch's behavior: Matriarchs now spawn in swarms, protected by other Hammerheads, and they try to keep the distance to the submarine. Boosted the explosion and increased the Spawn count.
- Added new missions about Hammerhead Matriarch.
- Revised all the creatures using the new behaviors.
- Changed how "attack when provoked" works. The previous state is now reset when the target changes. Also fixed several relate issues. Rename the property (requires action if custom characters use it). When a creature is attacked and "attack when provoked" is false and the attacker is not found in the predefined ai targets, the creature flees by default instead of just ignoring the attacker.
- Refactored the eating behavior: fixes small creatures not being able to eat significantly larger creatures.
- Adjusted the commonness and the reward of the Thresher swarm mission.
- Improved the indoors escaping behavior.
- Reduced the linear velocity when not facing the movement direction. Should fix monsters moving unnaturally when abruptly changing directions.
- Increased the swimming speeds of all monsters and adjusted the animations accordingly.
- Improved the path steering while swimming inside the submarine.
- Halved the swimming speeds inside the submarine.
- Increased the attack ranges for Hammerhead and Hammerhead gold to help them reach the targets.
- Don't allow large creatures like Bonethreshers or Hammerheads enter the submarine, because they easily get stuck and it's glitchy.
- Fixed characters that cannot enter the submarine still trying to target the inner walls.
- Fixed Tigerthresher and other creatures that can't attack the submarine bumping on the doors.
- Fixed characters occasionally getting stuck while trying to reach the last known position of the previous target.
- Fixed a crash when the creature is set to attack when provoked and when the damage source is null.
- Fixed extra creature being spawned when using the <monster> elements in the monster mission definitions.
- Fixed Hammerhead Matriarch's skirt going throught the walls.
- Fixed performance issues when creatures are trying to find a path out from the submarine while escaping. Also improved the escaping behavior in general.
- Fixed Mudraptors sometimes squeezing themselves towards doors without being able to attack them.
- Fixed monsters not reacting to being fired with turrets unless they can target the attacker.
- Fixed minor slipping in Mudraptor's walking animation.
- Weapons and tools now have ai targets that are only activated when the items are used -> shooting monsters should make you much more attractive target than just swimming peacefully around.

Multiplayer:
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that caused "missing entity" errors. However, there are many different reasons the error can occur, so even though we have not run into the issue anymore during out testing rounds, there is still a chance it may occur in some situations.
- Fixed inventory items occasionally getting mixed up in the multiplayer campaign.
- Fixed a bug that caused clients to get disconnected with an "invalid object header" error when a character has a large amount of different afflictions.

- Fixed server owner occasionally timing out if loading the round takes too long.
- Fixed server owner's character occasionally being killed due to round start timeouts.
- Fixed players not getting notified in any way when their connection to the server has timed out, allowing them to keep playing without being able to interact with anything.
- Made giveperm/giverank commands suck less by allowing names, endpoints and SteamIDs instead of clientlist id, and allowing users to skip question prompt by adding rank or perm as a second parameter.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign saves appearing in the single player "load game" menu if they're placed in the singleplayer save folder (leading to a crash if a player starts to load the save).
- Fixed server not sending condition updates for inactive items, potentially causing the condition to get desynced when all of the components of the item go inactive.
- Fixed clients only being informed of the reason for their ban the moment they're banned, but not if they try to rejoin.

- Increased default killdisconnectedtime to 2 minutes.
- Player cap can be adjusted in the server settings.
- Made "showseed" console command usable by clients.
- Fixed lobby command (which switches to the single player lobby) being usable in multiplayer.

Bugfixes:
- Fixes to render order oddities (structures with a depth > 0.5 always rendering behind all items, inconsistent render order between sub editor and in-game). Now structures with a depth of >= 0.9 are always behind everything (and visible through the LOS effect), and item's sprite depth is capped to 0.9.
- Fixed background structures that are resizeable on both axes always being drawn behind other background structures regardless of the sprite depth.
- Fixed Kastrull flooding when the drone undocks.
- Fixed ballast pumps deteriorating in Kastrull's drone despite being unreachable by the players.

- Fixed crashing if a modded UI style contains multiple child styles with the same name.
- Fixed wire nodes getting misplaced when flipping wires in the sub editor.
- Fixed groups of items that include wires sometimes not getting placed at the position of the cursor when pasting them in the sub editor.
- Fixed currents heavily slowing down the submarine regardless of the force or direction of the current.
- Fixed some held items vibrating/twitching when moving.
- Fixed turrets emitting muzzle flash particles in an incorrect direction (the rotation of the particle was correct but the direction it flew towards not, which isn't noticeable with the non-moving vanilla particles).
- Fixed "skip tutorials" returning to the main menu instead of opening the correct tab when starting a new game.
- Fixed all items being highlighted in the multiplayer campaign store menu when another player buys something.
- Fixed setting the number of items to buy by typing a number in the text box being practically impossible in the multiplayer campaign store.
- Fixed grenades exploding multiple times if you throw one, pick it up before it explodes and rethrow it.

- Fixed a couple of unfair ruin traps (rooms with coil/sensor placement that makes it impossible to pass through without getting zapped).
- Fixed mechanic tutorial getting softlocked if the player never has an oxygen tank (or aluminium) and sodium in their inventory at the same time. I.e. if they deconstruct the oxygen tanks first and put the aluminium in the fabricator, and then get the sodium and put it in the fabricator.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Networking/multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed the game occasionally freezing when joining a server.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused clients to disconnect with an "entity not found" error in the multiplayer. In technical terms, the issue occurred when the server spawned an entity with a given ID, sent a network event for that entity, and then spawned another entity that took up the ID of the previous entity. This could happen, for example, if in the multiplayer campaign a player happens to get an item with the same ID as an item in the inventory of another player who isn't currently present, and the other player joins the server. There are still most likely additional bugs that can cause similar error messages, so this fix will probably not get rid of the errors entirely.
- Fixed start button staying disabled in the server lobby when switching from the campaign mode to another game mode.
- Fixed clients occasionally getting disconnected due to the campaign store. Happened if a location had changed from one type to another (for example, natural formation to outpost), the players had bought something that wasn't originally available from the location and a new client joined.
- Fixed clients occasionally being prompted to download subs from the server even if they already have a matching sub.
- Fixed server having a password even if the password box is left empty in the in-game "host server" menu when hosting with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name being shortened to one word when hosting from the in-game "host server" menu with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name length not being restricted when set from serversettings.xml or using console commands.
- Fixed "ready to start" tickbox disappearing if a client joins while a round is running.
- Fixed traitors remaining as traitors client-side after restarting the round, allowing them to access the sabotage interface despite not having a traitor objective.
- Fixed characters occasionally not selecting/deselecting a periscope client-side, causing them to walk in place or not grab the periscope.
- Fixed male asian heads not appearing in the server lobby.
- Fixed campaign servers never being filtered out from the server browser when filtering based on game mode.
- Fixed clients not displaying the "could not connect" popup if the initial connection to a server times out.
- Fixed door weld state occasionally getting desynced, causing the door to be welded server-side but possible to open client-side.

Electricity fixes:
- Fixed junction boxes not passing signals to relays.
- Fixed broken junction boxes and relays carrying power.
- Fixed devices not receiving power if they're connected directly to batteries/supercapacitors with no relays or junction boxes in between.
- Fixed light components that receive power from somewhere else than a power input connection not going out when they lose power (e.g. lights on the diving suits).
- Fixed pumps and batteries operating/recharging faster when receiving overvoltage, with no upper limit, making it possible to for example operate pumps at 10x the speed by connecting them to a relay that's receiving 10x more power than is being drawn from it.
- Fixed LightComponents being toggled twice when they receive a signal to the toggle connection.

Misc fixes:
- Fixed "last used" listbox overlapping with the entity visibility tickboxes in the submarine editor on low resolutions.
- Fixed misaligned colliders on the "Shell A Cap 0 deg A/B" wall pieces.
- Fixed links disappearing between linked subs and docking ports when loading in the sub editor.
- Fixed loading freezing for up to 10 seconds if the game cannot fetch the remote content for the main menu (update notifications, changelogs, etc).
- Fixed lights on devices (junction boxes, nav terminals, reactor) being rendered on top of characters.
- Fixed lights lagging a little behind moving objects (e.g. diving suit light).
- Fixed characters being able to grab/heal others when handcuffed.
- Character editor: don't switch to the limb mode when clicking a limb in the joint edit mode. Fixes difficulties in using the joint angle widgets when the widgets are interloping limb source rects.
- Character editor: Fixed the texture path field not being copied if the source character has no texture path defined. In this case, we can use a texture path found in one of the limbs.
- Fixed bots incorrectly reporting problems in the room they are in instead of the room the issues is spotted at.
- Fixed bots reporting broken devices or asking medical attendance even if they are taking care of those things.
- Fixed bots saying "put out a fire in hull" instead of using the name of the room when they extinguish a fire.
- Fixed AITargets staying active even if the entity is not active (for example, the sonar could still be heard by monsters after it's turned off).
- The bots now only report about issues that have not been already been reported.
- Fixed monsters attacking doors that are open.
- Monsters keep pursuing the target if the behavior is "pursue" even when they cannot attack.
- Bots stop operating devices if a player starts operating them (unless they have been ordered to operate the device).

- Fixed bots sometimes stopping behind a closed door when trying to extinguish a fire.
- Fixed chat messages occasionally extending below the lower bound of the chatbox.
- Fixed searchlight and turret lights disappearing before the light is fully off-screen.
- Waypoint fixes in Kastrull and the drone.
- Fixed Kastrull flooding when the drone is undocked.
- Fixed ballast pumps in Kastrull's drone being off by default.
- Fixed enormous in-game ballistic helmet sprite.
- Fire extinguishers can't be placed inside toolboxes anymore.
- Fixed lobby screen not scaling correctly after changing to a bigger resolution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed characters with a rectangular main collider being unable to use path finding.
- Fixed microphone volume scrollbar resetting to the maximum value when opening the settings menu.
- Fixed a bug that caused occasional crashes on Linux when pinging servers in the server list menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc additions and changes:
- A new submarine, Kastrull.
- 6 new traitor missions with much more varied objectives.
- More variants of all job outfits.
- 30 new character face sprites.
- Overhauled job assignment logic to make the job distribution a little more balanced. Now each client gets assigned one of the spawnpoints (and its associated job) according to their job preference, which means that if the sub for example has 2x as many engineer spawnpoints than medic spawnpoints, there tend to be 2x more engineers. When playing with a mod that adds new jobs to the game, spawnpoints that have no job associated with them are considered spawnpoints for the non-vanilla jobs.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: does the job assignment seem fair, are people generally getting the jobs they want?
- New logic components: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, modulo, round, ceil, floor and factorial.
- Improved autopilot: much faster and less likely to get stuck.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: Is there still incentive to steer manually?
- AI characters don't set stationary batteries to recharge unless ordered to do so.
- Items can be made damageable by projectiles, melee weapons and explosions by adding DamagedByProjectiles="true", DamagedByMeleeWeapons="true" or DamagedByExplosions="true" to the config.
- Nerfed welding fuel + diving mask combo. The tank depletes much faster and one tank is only enough to make the target fall unconscious, not to kill them.
- Added deconstruction recipes to all drugs.
- Added huskified face sprites to all characters.
- Question prompts in the debug console and dedicated server console (such as "enter the reason to ban XXX") can be cancelled by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z (or Ctrl+C in the in-game debug console).
- Welding tools and plasma cutters explode when loaded with the wrong fuel.
- Removed sodium as a product of recycling fire extinguishers.
- Added some loose vents and panels to Orca and Typhon.
- Option to set a name for a character added by a mod without having to configure it in a separate text file. Use displayname="somemonster" in the character element to set the name.
- Balanced splash screen audio volumes.
- Alarm buzzers twitch when active to make it more clear where the sound is coming from.
- Scrollbars that work as on/off switches (e.g. power switches and autotemp sliders in item interfaces) can be toggled by clicking on them.
- Decreased the chance of selecting a traitor mission that's already been selected during the session.

Multiplayer:
- Option to choose a "play style" for the servers to tell the players what kind of gameplay and rules they can expect on the server.

	- More filtering options
		- Same version
		- Show whitelisted
		- Karma enabled
		- Traitors enabled
		- Friendly fire off
		- Voice chat enabled
		- Modded
	- Option to filter by play style.
	- Option to filter by game mode.
	- Added the option to favorite servers.
	- Added a list of recent servers.
	- Added a friends list, you can keep track on which servers your friends are playing at as well as join them directly from the friends list.
	- Miscellaneous layout improvements.
- Improved server lobby:
	- Improved character customization interface: players now have full control over their appearance.
	- Improved job preferences interface: players can now more easily switch around their class preferences, as well as pick which variation of an outfit they would like to wear.
	- Mission selection is more flexible: mission types can be toggled separately.
	- The campaign interface is displayed directly in the menu, not in a separate view.
	- The submarine preview is displayed directly in the menu without having to open a separate window.
	- The job preferences of other players are indicated in the player list.
	- Voice chat icon now indicates the loudness of the audio being transmitted/received.
	- Voice chat settings are indicated in the bottom-right corner of the chat box.
	- The server log is integrated into the chat box.
	- Added new server settings under anti-griefing tab which previously were only accessible through serversettings.xml.
		- Allow friendly fire.
		- Allow rewiring.
		- Allow disguises.
	- Miscellaneous layout changes.

Human AI:
- Changed the logic for automatically unequipping the diving gear, extinguishers or items that are held in hands.
- Taught the bots to place diving suits, fuel rods and fire extinguishers into right places, if they can't unequip the items without dropping them AND if the current objective is not high priority. The system uses tags/identifiers and two new attributes: "preferredcontainers" in Items and "containablerestrictions" in ItemComponents so it can be adjusted both in the editor and in xml.
- Improved the code to prevent dead-locks between the AI states.
- Start looking new oxygen when the current oxygen tank is at 10% instead of starting when it's empty (which often lead the bot to suffocate while doing the objective).
- Combat: Don't ignore empty weapons when evaluating weapons for the first time (allows to try reloading a weapon before ignoring it as useless).
- Fight Intruders: Automatically switch weapon when the current weapon runs out of ammo. Find ammunition for the current weapon if no other decent weapon is found. Don't allow to go offensive while armed with poor weapons, like a wrench.
- Fix Leaks: Improved the operating of welding tools.
- Rescue: Major refactoring. Allow to heal self. Improve the priority calculation. The priority is now based on the severity of wounds.
- Taught the bots to look deeper into the inventories (recursive) when seeking items.
- Changed the decision making on whether or not a bot needs diving gear.
- The bots now avoid unsafe paths in the idle state or when doing low priority objectives.
- The bots don't follow targets outside of the submarine.
- The bots don't stay still when idling underwater.They swim in place instead.
- Adjusted the combat priorities for the weapons.
- Increased the minimum initiatives.
- Adjusted the target evaluation for the Fix Leaks objective.
- Improved the distance approximations for all AI objectives.
- Increased the base devotion (how much the current objective priority is boosted).
- Reduced the shooting distance when the bots are operating turrets.
- Adjusted the idle waiting, standing, and walking times.
- Fixed bots getting stuck if the next node was behind a door.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when the main collider bottom was slightly lower than the floor level, even though the bot should be able to take off from the ladders.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when they need a new target while climbing.
- Fixed bots ignoring/avoiding targets in hulls when there were dead enemies inside them.
- Fixed issues in switching empty oxygen tanks to new.
- Fixed bots unequipping and re-equipping diving gear while ordered to follow another character.
- Fixed bots not being able to handle things when they cannot find diving gear. Now they should first try to get the gear and if it fails, they should just target a safe hull.
- Fixed bots shooting friendly characters with turrets.
- Fixed bots always treating weapons as revolvers.
- Fixed the loading of smg magazines/fuel tanks etc (because they are different from revolver rounds).
- Fixed autonomic objectives overriding the user-defined settings (steering, batteries).
- Fixed bots being able to do things while hand-cuffed.
- Fixed a dead-end when an item is taken by another character after the target item was defined and before the objective is completed.
- Fixed item prioritization calculations.
- Fixed hull safety calculations always using the current visible hulls (which should only be taken into account when the hull is the current hull).
- Fixed bots abandoning the operate item objective if there was another character operating the item.
- Fixed bots speaking about success/failure to repair when another character fixes their target.
- Fixed bots reporting individual failures when doing a loop objective. Should fix bots spamming with the "Cannot reach the target" msgs.
- Fixed the current objective not being reassigned after sorting the objectives, leading to sorting the subobjectives of the old current objective, which would be fixed only after the next time the objectives were sorted (after 1 sec).
- Fixed the gap size being misinterpreted when calculating the priority for a fix leak objective.
- Fixed bots switching repair targets while repairing an item.
- Fixed bots in some situations facing the wrong direction. The bots should now always face the item they are operating.
- Fixed bots' ragdolls getting unstable due to constant flipping in some rare cases.
- Fixed bots not immediately targeting the other rooms when they reach the airlock (when entering the submarine).

Monsters:
- New monster: Hammerhead Matriarch
- New monster: Hammerhead Spawn
- New diving suit sprite for husks.
- Characters now have a separate property that defines whether or not they can walk, meaning that characters can now enter the submarine even if they cannot walk. When there is no water, the character will fidget around.
Also fixes Fractal Guardians flying in non-flooded alien ruins.
- Monsters now remember the position of the last target even when idling. The memories fade, however.
- Monsters now flee briefly when being fired at with the turrets. Fixes swarming characters being easy to exploit.
- Don't allow the monsters to retaliate unless they are in the same submarine as the attacker. Removed the CanRetaliate parameter on character AI that was added in the previous update.
- Refactored ConditionalSprite: ConditionalSprite now takes Sprite or DeformableSprite as child elements.
- StatusEffects can now be used to spawn characters.
- Monster missions now support multiple monsters of different species.

- Charybdis: Increase the damage against structures for all attacks.
- Adjusted Mudraptor, Bonethresher and Tigerthersher behavior. Threshers now hunt in packs.
- Fixed incorrect flipping and mirroring. Disable mirroring on characters that don't need it.

- Fixed targeting at wall center position instead of the section position. Fixes hammerheads and bonethreshers targeting destroyed wall sections.
- Fixed the damage modifiers on hammerheads not working properly.
- Fixed a crash when trying to create a swarm with characters that have no swarming behavior defined.
- Fixed monsters not targeting the closest limb when they should.
- Fixed ai targets not being updated when the character is dead, causing the characters to be too perceivable/not perceivable enough by the monsters.
- Fixed limbs' lightsources not being visible inside the submarine.
- Fixed immobilized characters (e.g. stunned, monsters on dry land) occasionally "hanging" mid-air.
- Fixed draw order issues due to normal sprites and deformable sprites being used on the same characters.

Character editor:
- Added "TailTorqueBoost" parameter that can be used to prevent long and fast-moving characters, like the Tigerthresher, to get tangled around themselves.
- "TailTorque" no longer affects the swimming sine amplitude (how strong the tail moves).
- Sprite orientation no longer affects the damage modifiers.
- Exposed the ragdoll main limb.
- Exposed the damage emitters.
- Exposed the damage sound of damage modifiers.
- The radial widget angles are now rounded to the closest 10.
- Fixed characters being able to collide with the submarine, which often caused large monsters to get stunned and impact sounds to be played when they're spawned.
- Fixed characters moving when they shouldn't.

Bugfixes:
- Rewrote power distribution logic to resolve several issues and oddities in the way power was distributed across electrical grids, particularly when relays were used. The new system is also less performance intensive, so submarines that had performance issues due to large and complex power grids should now run better.
- Fixed inability for mods to override jobs.
- Fixed pumps calculating targetlevel incorrectly when receiving a "set_targetlevel" signal, causing neutral ballast level value in the sub editor to be off.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers when they're using content packages the server doesn't have, which usually causes the client to get disconnected when a round starts.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers after enabling a required content package in the settings, even though they need to restart first (leading to errors when a round starts).
- Fixed "attempted to access a potentially removed character" console errors if a character dies while the client is waiting to apply the character's remote inventory state.
- Fixed broken waypoints in Typhon that prevented bots from opening some of the doors.
- Fixed characters being very hard or impossible to hit with melee weapons when they're lying on the floor.
- Fixed characters placing their feet above a platform when not actually standing on the platform (noticeable in rooms where there's a platform on top of the "actual" floor).
- Fixed husk eggs not causing a husk infection when injected.
- Fixed depth sorting not working on damageable structures.
- Fixed characters stepping on nothing if their feet are below the lowest step of a ladder.
- Fixed door components being selectable when the door is broken, causing characters to drop from ladders if they interact with a door while climbing.
- Alien motion sensors don't react to dead bodies to prevent bodies from blocking the way through the ruins by constantly activating coils.
- Fixes to waypoints and outdated structure sourcerects in Bunyip, Selkie & Venture.
- Put the shotgun shells in Dugong's, Kastrull's and Humpback's armory inside the shotgun.
- Fixed clients retaining their original character when taking control of another one in the multiplayer campaign, but keeping the items of the new character.

- Don't allow reporting things while inside ruins.
- Fixed crashing if a client has written something in the chatbox, gets disconnected and sends the message.
- Fixed servers showing up in the server lobby after the server has been shut down.

- Fixed dead characters still appearing in the crew list when a client joins mid-round.
- Fixes to decorative sprites: Rotation property is in degrees, fixed offset anim type being used as the rotation anim.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monster additions and changes:
- New character: Bonethresher.
- New character: Golden Hammerhead.
- Completely remade the Tigerthresher (new skin, ragdoll, behavior and attacks).
- Reworked Hammerhead (new ragdoll, adjusted behavior and attacks).
- Adjusted the behavior of most characters.
- Medium sized monsters can now more easily trigger impact effects when ramming the submarine.
- Characters are now allowed to move faster than previously (9 -> 15).
- Changed the mouth position calculations and redefined the values for all monsters that have the eating behavior.
- Removed Moloch Baby (Which was just a test. Molochs will be revisited later).
- Better bend deformations on limbs.
- Better feedback about hit impacts on limbs when the character takes damage.
- AI monsters should hit moving targets more easily.
- Added configurable health regeneration, which is applied when the character is eating a corpse.
- Added configurable affliction reductions (bleeding, burn, damage).
- Added an option for the monsters to ignore retaliation when they are attacked.
- Added an option to target the attack on specific limb types.
- Added an option to continue the movement, "following through" the target after the attack.

Modding improvements:
- Mods can override specific content without having to create a completely new content package. This can
be done by surrounding the element with "<override></override>" (for example, an Item or a Character
config element you want to replace a vanilla Item/Character with). The overrides work based on identifiers;
for instance, if you configure an item with the identifier "wrench" and surround it with the override
tags, it will replace the vanilla wrench.
- Content package load order: the game will first load the core package, then other content in the order
 of selection (proper ui still pending). The load order is saved in the config_player.xml.
- Made AI orders and event manager settings moddable.
- The engine and reactor sound ranges can now be modified in the item XML.
- The husk affliction can now be modified and applied on any character.
- Support for multiple simultaneous husk afflictions based on the same system.
- Support for multiple husk appendages. Made the attachment limb configurable in the affliction definition.
- Additional content package validity checks during startup: make sure all XML files in the package can
be loaded, and disable the package if they can't. Fixes tons of console errors on startup when a mod with
invalid XML files is enabled.
- Don't allow publishing workshop items that contain invalid XML files.
- Don't allow selecting invalid content packages in the settings menu.
- Fixed disabled content packages becoming active when they're autoupdated.

- New functionality: creating limbs (without having to operate on duplicates).
- Support for creating humanoids.
- Allow to create new characters based on an existing character (copy character).
- Added a limb specific "sprite orientation" that overrides the universal "spritesheet orientation".
- Option for mirroring limb sprites.
- Option for hiding the limb sprite (invisible limbs).
- Multiple minor additions and changes, like an option to enable lights or to display the damage modifiers
drawn on the character.
- Exposed structure sound types.
- Exposed the mouth position.
- Exposed the angular damping and density for limbs (removed mass, which was not used).

ports are close to another docking port, even if the terminal in question is not wired to that port.
- Fixed an occasional crash when a bot starts retreating away from an enemy immediately after spawning.
- Fixed clients not creating a download prompt when a sub they don't have is selected by vote.
- Fixed traitor missions almost always placing the mission-related items inside the same containers.
- Fixed traitor goal durations being displayed as "duration(xx) seconds" instead of "xx seconds".
- Fixed Traitor's "find an item" objectives not being considered complete if the target item is inside
another item within the traitor's inventory.
- Fixed server using the provided campaign savefile name as-is (without the required .save file extension)
when starting a new campaign through the console. Caused clients to throw "File transfer failed (wrong
file extension """!)" errors and prevented them from receiving the save files.
- Fixed servers being able to start the round multiple times by spamming the "start" console command
before loading the round finishes.

- Fixed damaged item sprites that are set to fade in according to the damage always being drawn at full opacity.
- Fixed spectators being distributed into teams in combat missions, potentially leading to imbalanced crew sizes.
- Notify the client using the "togglekarmatestmode" command about the test mode being enabled/disabled.
- Send karma change notifications when karma has changed by 1 unit or more when test mode is enabled, not
just when an action causes an immediate change of 1 unit or more.
- Fixed adjacent sprites bleeding into the platform and topwindow sprites.
- Fixed autocompleting submarine/shuttle names when using the submarine/shuttle console commands.
- Fixed some items (like sonar beacon) attracting monsters even when they're powered off.
- Fixed inability to open the pause menu if an inventory slot had been highlighted when exiting
the game screen.
- Fixed welded door sprites "twitching" when the submarine moves.
- Fixed crashing when a character with no hands or arms drops a holdable item.
- Non-humanoids (i.e. monsters controlled by a player) cannot be assigned as traitors.
- Traitor missions are considered unsuccessful if the objectives cannot be completed (for example if the
submarine doesn't have suitable containers to place the traitor items inside).
- Fixed the "Barotrauma" title text staying invisible in the main menu when coming back from the credits.
- Fixed clients not refreshing an item's editing hud when a remote player adjusts the values (i.e. if two
players had selected the same lamp and one changed the color value, the other client wouldn't see
the value change in the editing hud).
- Fixed a couple of the additive light sprites being slightly offset from the lamp.
- Clients don't display client-side vitality changes in healthbars until the actual vitality is received
from the server. Fixes health occasionally dropping and then jumping back up if the client predicts damage
incorrectly (e.g. if a melee attack hits client-side but doesn't server-side).
- Fixed character syncing being very inaccurate when switching to freecam and spectating a character
far away from other players.
- Fixed oxygen/fuel tanks attached to a tool being rendered behind the character's legs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added Polish, Spanish and Turkish NPC conversations.
- Improvements to Russian and Spanish translations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3.1

- Fixed clients with campaign management permissions not seeing the permissions of newly joined clients.
- Fixed statuseffects with a duration not having an effect on karma.
- Causing an "oxygen low" affliction decreases karma (for example when injecting large amounts of fentanyl).
- Fixed scroll values resetting in the multiplayer campaign store menu when purchasing/selling items.

Miscellaneous improvements:

spawned automatically when the SMG/coilgun is fired.
- Hid the junction box tutorial variant from the sub editor.
- Stun guns and darts can be fabricated and purchased.
- More reliable melee weapon hit detection (for example in the security tutorial it was previously very
difficult to hit the crawler after it falls to the ground).
- Enemies steer back towards the level if they end up outside the boundaries.
- Added confirmation popups when exiting the sub editor or character editor to prevent losing unsaved work.
- Fixed reactor warning lights being clickable and becoming invisible when pressed.
- Fixed CPR button becoming invisible when pressed.
- Fixed water occasionally flowing only through one gap in a hull, for example water only draining
through a hole at a one side of a room even if there is another hole at the other side of the room.

path even if the file is in a subfolder.
- Fixed contentpackage version number not being updated when updating an older workshop item.
- Fixed subinventories closing when items are dropped into or removed from them, which made reloading
weapons or putting several items into a container cumbersome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Karma improvements:
- Attacking someone who has just recently attacked you doesn't reduce karma.
- The karma penalty from attacking someone scales according to their karma (i.e. smaller penalty for
attacking a griefer whose karma is low).
- Damaging characters by performing CPR doesn't decrease karma.
- Fixed karma decreasing when moving a wire from a connection to another.
- Reviving characters with CPR increases karma.
- Made the default karma settings a little less strict.

contains Chinese symbols for example.
- Fixed inability to enable/update content packages created for a version prior to 0.9.2.0 (ones that have
the content package in the Data/ContentPackages folder instead of in the mod folder).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing if a traitor client switches to a non-human creature and their original character dies.

to an item that doesn't have one.
- Fixed "error loading submarine" console error when creating a copy of a submarine, deleting the original
sub and then saving the copy.
- Fixed server logging an "attempted to send a chat message to a null client" error when a client tries
to send a private message to a non-existent client.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easier server hosting:
- Switched to Steam's networking API, which allows clients to connect to servers without the need for the
host to forward their ports.

Expanded traitor feature:
- Multi-step traitor missions that not only make things more interesting to the traitors themselves but
also to give the rest of the crew a fighting chance of detecting the traitor.

Anti-griefing:
- Karma: a system that detects malicious actions and automatically creates a more challenging experience
for griefers, or potentially triggers a kickban. The feature is completely optional and the server hosts
can decide how aggressively it will react to malicious actions. In a nutshell, you can lose karma for doing
dumb things, karma is regained gradually over time and may be increased more rapidly by doing good things,
thus negating false positives and also giving you the chance to redeem yourself. Lose too much karma and
you'll start to experience increasing levels of inconvenience.
- Wire griefing is more difficult: wires have to be disconnected from the connection panels at both ends
before they can be removed. Disconnected wires can be seen visibly hanging from the device, with noticeable
particle effects and sound cues that make it easier to detect and fix wiring problems.
- Added a built-in overheat warning light and siren to reactors and increased the time it takes for the
reactor to catch fire and explode.
- Option to disable friendly fire altogether.

New items and structures:
- Additional weapons: stun gun, SMG, shotgun, grenade launcher, flamer, two new types of coilgun ammunition (piercing & explosive).
- New monster loot: husk stinger, mudraptor shell, crawler mask, moloch shell.
- Fun stuff: accordion, captain's pipe, toy hammer.
- Tons of new decorative submarine pieces for the sub editor.

New submarine:
- Berilia, a submarine for 16 players.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing when selecting doors or gaps in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when combining items inside an ItemContainer (e.g. cabinet, deconstructor).
- Fixed shuttles not being able to redock into some submarines with unconventionally positioned docking
ports. Specifically, if a port needed to be docked to from below but was positioned above the center of
the submarine (or vice versa), the docking interface would not activate on the navigation terminal.
- Fixed docking port using the wrong submarine's position for joint adjustment, causing errors when
docking a submarine with greater mass to one with a smaller mass.
- Fixed an issue that caused occasional ID mismatch errors if a client died during a multiplayer
campaign round and disconnected before the round ended.
- Fixed item editing panel not appearing in wiring mode when selecting a wire in the sub editor.
- Fixed ability to throw throwable items while unconscious.
- Fixed bots not using fire extinguishers client-side in multiplayer.
- Fixed clients not hearing the sound when someone crowbars a door open.
- Fixed progress bars not showing client-side when cutting/welding doors.
- Fixed inability to combine items in multiplayer.

scale in the submarine editor.
- Fixed inability to scroll the crew list with the mouse wheel when the cursor is over certain parts
of the list.
- Fixed sonar pings stopping mid-way when active sonar is turned off, which could be exploited to stop
the pings before they reach a monster further away from the sub.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters when entering spectator mode after their character has been
eaten by a creature.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters in spectator mode after the distance between the submarine
and the client's corpse gets great enough.
- Fixed clients getting stuck to a non-functional game screen if they start a new round before the ending
cinematic has finished server-side.
- Fixed projectiles hitting a character you're standing next to when firing.
- Fixed characters automatically equipping handcuffs (i.e. handcuffing themselves) if they were picked up
when the only free inventory space was the hand slots.
- Fixed a rare race condition that occasionally caused the game to crash during the loading screen with
a "no text packs available in English!" error message.
- Fixed husk infection being healable with broad-spectrum antibiotics even when the infection has reached
the final stage.
- Fixed attachable items (detonators, electrical components) becoming deattachable without any tools
if the sub is saved after deattaching them.
- Fixed projectile raycasts not taking wall rotation into account, causing the projectiles to hit sloped
walls when standing next to them.
- Fixed PowerTransfer components checking overloads based on the item the recursive power check starts from,
not the item that's currently being checked. Caused junction boxes to never break or catch fire in some subs
- Fixed crashing in the character editor when no textures were found for the selected character.
- Fixed crashing if a humanoid character has no knees or ankles.
- Fixed EventManager calculating flooding amount incorrectly, causing floods to only have a very small
effect on the intensity value.
- Fixed batteries and supercapacitors being able to provide power through their signal connections
(e.g. "set_charge_rate", "charge_rate_out").
- Lighting fix: obstruct background lights behind hulls. Previously the background lights would only get
obstructed by background structures, causing light to "bleed through" parts with no structures (e.g.
humpback's docking port) and windows in the background walls.
- Fixed item loading being interrupted if any item XML cannot be loaded, causing some items not to be
loaded if any of the selected content packages are missing files or contain corrupted item XMLs.
- Fixed fire sounds not playing when standing inside a fire source.
- Fixed client names being converted to lower case when comparing them to the name written by the sender,
preventing the message from being sent if the name wasn't written in lower case.
- Pass private messages to the client hosting the server when the message is targeted to the server.
- Private messages appear in the server log.
- Fixed plasma cutter and welding tool hit particles being offset from the flame.
- Fixed steel bar and titanium-aluminium alloy deconstructing to 100% condition items even when degraded
(which could be used as an exploit to get infinite coilgun rounds).
- Fixed holdable items staying in the characters hand(s) when swapping them from a hand slot to another
limb slot (for example, when moving a flashlight from a hand slot to the head slot).
- Fixed text wrapping not working properly with words that are longer than a single line.
- Fixed deconstructor losing some of the material from deconstructed items if the output container couldn't hold all of the new items.
- Fixed discrepancies in door welding & repairing logic regarding collision.
- Fixed a crash when retrieving lobby information with an uninitialized IP.
- Fixed max player count in server list & duplicate lobby entries.
- Fixed arrow keys not changing caret position when typing.
- Fixed doors looking repaired as soon as the condition goes above 0%, even though the collisions aren't
re-enabled until the door gets above 50%.
- Fixed water not leaking through broken doors.
- Fixed inability to throw items through platforms.

Misc additions and changes:
- Respawn shuttles now spawn inside the level somewhere near the submarine, instead of always spawning
at the beginning of the level.
- Respawn shuttles don't leave and despawn until a new respawn is pending.
- Added "respawnnow" console command which immediately dispatches the respawn shuttle.
- Search for default animation/ragdoll folders from the folder where the character file is located, not
from "Content/Characters". Fixes mods not being able to load animation/ragdoll files if the file paths
are not defined explicitly in the character configuration file.
- Improved performance by deleting dead monsters that are far away from the sub and by disabling physics
on dead bodies when they stay still long enough.
- Added option to use conditionals to activate/deactivate ItemComponents. You can take a look at the
reactor and junction box config files to see how it's used.
- Added some indicator lights to junction boxes and reactors.
- Stun batons don't affect large enemies (molochs, hammerheads, endworms, etc).
- In wiring mode, items are selected by pressing E instead of clicking. Selecting items with the left
mouse button made it very difficult to manipulate the wires because it was easy to accidentally select
some device instead of a wire node.
- Crate/toolbox inventories stay open and can be moved across the screen when the item is equipped.
- Added limits to submarine name and description length.
- Delete incomplete file downloads when disconnecting from a server while a file transfer is active.
Prevents console errors about corrupted submarine/save files caused by the partially downloaded files.
- Increased Humpback's battery capacity.
- Added widgets for manipulating coilgun/railgun rotation limits in the sub editor.
- Added a command for setting the value of a property on all selected entities in the sub editor
(for example, "setentityproperties scale 2" would set the scale of all selected items/structures to 2).
- Show ballast tanks and airlocks in a different color on the status monitor to make it easier to
distinguish which rooms are actually flooding and which are supposed to have water in them.
- Option to define multiple inventory variants for a character (e.g. to add variation to monster loot).
- Start playing the main menu music during the loading screen.
- More reliable human walk sounds (played at specific points of the walk cycle instead of relying on
impacts between the feet and the floor).
- Option to show a 16x16 grid and snap the cursor to it in the sprite editor.
- Reactor can be controlled with movement keys.
- Option to add a probability for afflictions applied by an attack.
- Husk attacks have a 50% chance of causing a husk infection.
- Decreased minimum item scale from 0.1 to 0.01.
- The amount of materials received from deconstructing fuel rods depends on the condition of the fuel rod.
- Reactors keep sending the temperature_out signal after a meltdown.
- Improved file transfer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- Disabled riot shields for now (too much griefing potential).
- Toolboxes can be fabricated and decontructed.
- Nerfed nitroglycerin's structure damage and increased the impact tolerance from 4 to 6.
- Made alien pistols a little less underwhelming (sounds, recoil, particle effects).
- Deconstructors drop all items that are inside the deconstructed item. Previously they would just get destroyed,
making it a potential exploit to destroy items that should not be possible to deconstruct.
- Modified welding fuel tank and oxygen tank sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Modified plasma cutter and welding tool sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Diving suits play the warning beep when there's no tank in the suit (not just when the tank is running out).
- Server list can be sorted according to ping, name, compatibility or any of the other property in the list.
- Docking ports of the enemy submarine are not shown on the sonar during combat missions.
- Recharge headset batteries between rounds in single player.

- The game automatically opens the generated crash report when it crashes.
- Added "setmaxplayers" command to the dedicated server.
- Clients can change the server password using the command "setpassword" if they have a permission from the host.
- Reduced the range of the sonar ping sound and added a more subtle ping sound that can be heard further away.
- Watchmen now hold position when attacked.
- Added a subtle glow to alien buttons to make them a bit more noticeable.
- Items that are set to be hidden in-game can still be interacted with in the sub editor.
- EXPERIMENTAL: option to disable rewiring items in multiplayer. At the moment the setting can only be
changed by editing a parameter called "allowrewiring" in serversettings.xml.

Misc bugfixes:
- Fixed the position of an outpost's docking port not being taken into account when determining how to
place it in the level. Caused large submarines sometimes to collide with walls when docked to outposts
where the port is offset from the center.
- Fixed corrupted sub files causing crashes.
- Fixed item editing HUD not appearing on any other item after one item has been selected in-game
(e.g. editing the channel on a wifi component prevented editing other items).
- Fixed ladders and other resizeable items reverting to their original size if they're resized and
the sub is saved and reloaded.
- Fixed inability to resize gaps in the sub editor after they've been placed.
- Reactors take other power sources into account when calculating how much power they need to generate.
Fixes overloads on Humpback when turning on the backup batteries and operating the reactor normally.
- Fixed watchmen not retaliating when a character does very small amounts of damage to them.
- Fixed bots being able to take handcuffs off from themselves.
- Fixed waypoint and spawnpoints being selectable in the sub editor even if they're hidden.
- Fixed deconstructing coilgun ammo boxes giving out more materials than the materials required to fabricate them.
- Scrollbars can only be dragged if the mouse button is pressed down while the cursor is on the scrollbar,
not by holding the button and moving it on the scrollbar. Fixes accidentally switching from slider
to another (often happens in the reactor interface).
- Fixed crashing when setting limb or joint scale to 0 using console commands.
- Fixed dropdowns in the Workshop item publish menu being draw behind the buttons below them.
- Fixes bots being unable to exit ladders if some part of their body is below the platform.
- Ignore keyboard inputs (delete, arrow keys, copy/paste) in the sub editor when a textbox is selected.
Prevents accidentally deleting items/structures when attempting to delete text from a textbox.
- Toolboxes can't be put inside other toolboxes or in the doctor's clothes.
- Fixed items bought from the store during a singleplayer campaign session being deducted from the credits
when save & quitting from the map.
- Flares stop emitting particles when inside an inventory.
- Fixed oxygen not flowing through horizontal gaps between subs (e.g. between Remora and the drone).
- Decreased the size of the mountain in the RidgeBasic level type to prevent it from blocking the main path.
- Fixed too small collider sizes on a bunch of crafting materials.
- Fixed order options ("hold fire"/"fire at will" etc) being displayed in one button instead of
being split into separate buttons when playing the game in Chinese.

by being inside a respawn shuttle when it despawns.
- Fixed sonar not scaling properly when resolution is changed mid-round.
- Fixed fabricators & deconstructors displaying the "insufficient power" warning when power is low
(but still high enough for the devices to run).

Networking fixes:
- Fixed another ID mismatch problem that occasionally caused clients to get kicked out in multiplayer,
usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed players always getting range banned when banned by a client.
- Fixed turrets not being aimed correctly in multiplayer if they're in another sub (e.g. the coilgun in
Remora's drone).
- More reliable fabricator and deconstructor syncing. Should fix items disappearing when multiple players
attempt to use the device at the same time and strange timing inconsistencies when deconstructing
multiple items in succession.
- Fixed all servers showing "unknown" as the game mode in the server list.
- Fixed server not allowing forward slashes in host messages.
- Fixed repair interface sometimes getting stuck close to 100% in multiplayer.

Character editor fixes and improvements:
- Nicer layout, made the panels hideable.
- Added buttons for creating joints, duplicating limbs, and deleting limbs/joints.
- A dropdown for selecting which content package to add the character to.
- Allow creating a new content package during character creation.
- Added hotkeys 1, 2, 3 for limb, joint, and animation modes respectively.
- Change the logic of deciding on which parameters are shown and when. In the ragdoll mode you can now
see the ragdoll, but also scale it and see the main parameters. Source rects are now longer shown on the
sprite sheet if limbs mode is disabled.
- Automatically select edit limbs mode when a new character is created.
- Option to create multiple limbs in the character creation wizard.
- Disallow deleting the main limb because it often causes crashes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.0.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Made husks more common.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed an ID mismatch problem that occasionally caused clients to get kicked out in the multiplayer
campaign, usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed servers using a local campaign save path sent by the client setupping the campaign, preventing
the campaign from starting up if the path does not exist at the server's end.
- Fixed radio communication occasionally not working between characters in the multiplayer campaign. Characters
that had made it through at least one round were not able to communicate through radio with characters that
have just been spawned for the first time.
- Kick votes persist during a multiplayer session even if the client disconnects (= disconnecting and rejoining
just before you get kicked doesn't work anymore).
- The server sends a "this client previously used the name xxx" message when a client rejoins with a different name.
- Fixed GameServer.UnbanPlayer passing the name to BanList in lower case even though BanList was case
sensitive (preventing unbanning clients with the "unban" command if their name is not in lower case).
- Fixed server not saving the whitelist when it's enabled/disabled, causing the setting to revert when
relaunching the server.
- Fixed structure texture scale and texture offset now being reverting to default values when the
submarine is saved by the server, causing them to reset between campaign rounds.
- Fixed client always launching the default "DedicatedServer.exe" even if using a content package that
should replace the server exe.
- Servers only report content packages with files that cause multiplayer incompatibility to the master server.
Fixes servers showing up as incompatible in the server list if they have custom sub files (or other types
of files that don't cause compatibility issues) installed.

possible to change the resolution when in fullscreen without having to restart the game.
- Fixes to the DXGI crashes during startup.
- Fixed Character.GetConfigFile searching for the character file from all available content packages, not
just the ones that are currently selected. Caused modded character files to affect the game even when
the mod was not enabled, leading to various issues such as characters failing to equip items if the mod
changes the number or type of inventory slots a character has.
- Fixed a bug in monster/item spawnpoint logic that occasionally caused perfectly valid spawnpoints to be
discarded when there were floating ice chunks in the level, sometimes causing monsters to spawn very
far from the submarine (which often lead to the player not running into them at all).
- Fixed bots not being able to retaliate when attacked with a repair tool.
- Fixed crashing when firing a revolver in the sub editor.
- Fixed items applying their status effects twice if they're put into a container by swapping them with
another item. For example, replacing a fuel rod in the reactor by dropping a new fuel rod on it caused
the reactor behave as if it had two rods in it.
- Switches send out a continuous 0/1 signal that can be flipped by interacting with the switch (as opposed
to working like buttons which send out a pulse when interacted with).

- Fixed crash after opening the file browser from the Workshop menu more than once on Linux.
- Fixed combat mission achievements being impossible to unlock.
- Fixed item scales not being saved when the scale is modified in the sub editor.
- Fixed incorrect physicorium shell description.
- Fixed server list & workshop menu not resizing properly when changing resolution.

- Fixed ability to drop items into secure lockers (or other containers that require specific items)
without having access to it.
- Automatically move the gaps linked to doors when the door is moved (and vice versa).
- Fixed items disappearing when they're dropped into a full container.
- Fixed crashing when an item that requires aim to use is used by something else than a character
(e.g. a status effect).
- Fixed having a broken device on a sub in the sub editor and switching to Character Mode causing a crash.
- Fixed the bottom of the background ice texture not rendering correctly on high resolutions.

Additions and changes:
- New control scheme: items are selected by left clicking, deselected with right click or esc, and held
items are used on devices by pressing E (e.g. when rewiring with a screwdriver or repairing something
with a wrench). The new controls are somewhat experimental; the intention is to make them more intuitive
to new players. You can still switch back to the legacy control scheme from the game settings.
- Set default radio chat keybind to R and creature attack keybind to Mouse3.

at their end.
- More reliable item wall attaching syncing.
- Servers don't attempt to send position updates for items that have no enabled physics body (e.g. attached
items). Fixes "received a position update for an item with no physics body" console errors when attaching
items to walls.
- Fixed spectate button staying visible when a round ends while a client is in the lobby.

has no active StatusEffects).
- Fixed severed limbs occasionally noclipping into the submarine.
- Fixed large engine emitting smoke before it becomes repairable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

next, option to rewatch the videos and re-read the instructions.
- Overhauled charybdis (still a work in progress though).

a "ShowInHealthScannerThreshold" attribute to the affliction.
- Added labels next to periscopes in Humpback and Dugong.
- Modified Humpback's bilge to make it easier for AI characters to fix.
- Enemies can now navigate out from the sub when escaping.
- Bunch of tweaks to monster AIs (targeting priorities, attack cooldowns, etc).
- Made InventoryIconColor and ContainerColor properties saveable.
- Removed descriptive name from alien artifacts (so be extra careful when bringing them on board).
- Allow panning the campaign map with WASD.
- Allow editing selected wires in wiring mode (so it's possible to, for example, modify the colors of
the wires without having to disconnect them).
- Decreased structure damage done by frag grenades and made them disappear after they've exploded.
- Batteries output charge values as integers.
- Made damaged junction boxes less sensitive to overvoltage. Nearly broken junction boxes were barely able
to handle any overvoltage, leading to chain reaction where one junction box breaking causes the grid to be
overloaded, and the rest of the boxes start taking damage at an increasing speed.
- Reactors don't cool down when underwater anymore.
- Removed minimum conditions from battery deconstruction output (= deconstructing an empty battery still
gives the materials used to craft the battery).
- Made a bunch of ItemContainer UI panels larger.
- Items can be dragged and dropped directly from the inventory into containers without having to select
the container first.
- Plants can be picked up from the environment without any tools.
- Added more help texts to highlighted items ("[E] Interact", "[E] Climb"...)

Multiplayer fixes:
- Changes to event syncing logic to prevent cases where clients fall behind the server and get kicked out
due to the server not being able to send out network events to the clients fast enough.
- Networking optimizations that prevent level objects and continuously deteriorating items from creating
excessive amounts of network events.
- Fixed windows clients being unable to start a campaign in servers running on Linux.
- Fixed clients being unable to start a campaign using a submarine that's not in the default Submarine
folder at the server's side.
- Fixed loading submarine files and campaign saves occasionally failing when running multiple instances
of the game from the same install location (for example, a dedicated server executable and a client
executable).
- Don't transfer files through the network when sending them to the owner of the server (i.e. a client
hosting directly from the main executable).
- Fixed fires and water occasionally getting out of sync between a client using the fire/water console
commands and the server.
- Fixed clients disconnecting with an "unknown object header" error if they fail to read a network event
(when they should instead report the error to the server and wait for a message that contains a more
descriptive error).
- Campaign fix: clear missions from locations that change their type, and all adjacent locations. Not
clearing them caused missions to still be available when they logically shouldn't be (e.g. a transport
mission from an uninhabited location to another) and syncing issues in multiplayer.
- Disable campaign start button if a round is already running when joining.
- Fixed clients being unable to end campaign rounds at all if the sub isn't at the start/end outpost
(regardless if they have the permission to end the round or not).
- Fixed campaign characters still being displayed in the server lobby after the game mode has been
changed to something else.
- Fixed items in the characters inventory always starting at 100% condition client-side even if they had
deteriorated during the previous round.
- Fixed LevelResource (mineral, plant, etc) deattach timers not being synced with clients.
- AI characters can take out excess fuel rods from the reactor when needed.
- Item interfaces and the health interface can be closed with Esc.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed almost all items using default repair duration values (10 seconds with high skills, 100 seconds
with low skills) instead of the ones configured in the item XMLs.
- Nuclear shells and nuclear depth charges disappear after they've exploded.
- Fixed "trying to add a dead character to crewmanager" errors when attempting to revive a character
killed by some other affliction than internal damage, bleeding or burns.
- Take the position of a sub's docking port into account when determining where to place outposts.
Previously the outposts were simply placed midway between the adjacent walls, which occasionally caused
problems with submarines whose docking port is close to the bow or tail.
- Fixed a bug in relay components that caused a bunch of issues in power grids that utilize relays:
Relays would receive the full amount of power from the grid regardless of the load of the devices
connected to the power_out connection, causing unnecessary overloads and fires.
- Fixed batteries being able to draw power through relay components that are connected directly to
a power source, even if the relay isn't on.
- Don't allow steering the sub with WASD when a textbox is selected.
- Use the SpriteColor of the item when drawing the moving parts of turrets and doors.
- Fixed steering issues that caused monsters to swim in an incorrect direction when they're targeting
something inside the sub.
- Fixed a crash due when scaling the Mudraptor.
- Fixed crashing if a character has neither a head angle or a torso angle configured.
- Fixed characters always being created in the default folder in the character editor.
- Monsters don't target doors/hatches at the exterior of the sub when inside or inner doors when outside.
- Don't display disabled limbs on sonar (i.e. severed limbs that have "faded out").
- Close the save/load dialogs when leaving the sub editor. Otherwise they'll still be visible when
re-entering the editor, and saving at that point will overwrite the previously loaded sub with an empty one.
- Removing an item after it's been combined doesn't trigger the OnBroken StatusEffects (e.g. combining two
half-full flash powder jars doesn't cause them to explode).
- Fixed welding tools and plasma cutters not hitting targets if the barrel is inside the target (e.g. if
trying to weld a completely broken wall with the cutter partially inside the wall).
- Fixed very small mineral colliders that made them extremely hard to hit with the plasma cutter.
- Fixed items with no sprite crashing the game (now they just cause a console error).
- Don't allow autointeracting with contained items (e.g. picking up an ammunition box from a loader)
if another item is currently selected. Makes it less likely for players to accidentally pick up items
from containers when they deselect another item.
- Fixed characters not letting go of the character they're grabbing when the health interface is closed
by clicking outside the window.
- Fixed CrewManager throwing errors if changing resolutions when a crew member is dead.
- Fixed items emitting light from inside containers in the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- The fission rate gauge on the reactor now visualizes the amount of fuel available.
- Doors and hatches can now also be repaired with wrenches.
- Changed default StatusEffect conditional comparison type back to OR.
- Clients communicate syncing errors to the server, and the server logs a more descriptive error about
what went wrong. Should make it easier to diagnose disconnection issues from now on.
- Ending a multiplayer campaign round by talking to watchman doesn't require any special permissions.
- Server automatically ends rounds if there have been no players alive in 60 seconds and respawning
is not allowed during the round.
- Added a button for resetting an entity's properties to the default values to the sub editor.
- Updated handheld sonar UI graphics.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed non-radio chat/VOIP having an unlimited distance.
- Fixed a networking bug that caused the server to send item state changes to the clients before sending
a message about the item being spawned. For example, spawning any item with a LightComponent would always
cause clients to get disconnected.
- Changes to the way the clients are put in sync with the server when joining mid-round. Should make it
less likely for clients to get disconnected immediately after starting a round.
- StatusEffects only apply non-limb-specific afflictions to one limb even if targeting the whole character.
Fixes drugs like fentanyl and morphine being way too harmful due to the oxygen loss affliction being
applied once per every limb.
- Fixed TargetItemComponentName not working in StatusEffect conditionals (making it impossible to create
conditionals that target a specific component of an item).
- Made all of the new medical items combinable and usable in a syringe gun (assuming the drug is in a syringe).
- Fixed inability to throw anything in the multiplayer.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign setup UI showing the client's subs instead of the server's.
- Fixed campaign view button overlapping with the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby.
- Fixed sub/mode voting not being enabled when changing the setting after the server has been started.
- Fixed character inventories occasionally being saved incorrectly in the multiplayer campaign when an
- Fixed flares not activating by left clicking.
- Fixed affliction icons flickering rapidly in the health interface and above the health bar if their
strength is fluctuating around the threshold where the icon becomes visible.
- Fixed dedicated server crashing when typing in more text than can fit on one line.
- Fixed enemies "fleeing" after they have been shot. There was a steering issue when they targeted characters
inside the sub while being outside.
- Fixed Hammerhead attack causing warping.
- Fixed incorrect submarine and level seed in server logs when playing campaign mode.
- Hide the start button from the campaign UI if the client doesn't have the permission to manage
the campaign or rounds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
- A major overhaul on the crew AI. They should now be much better at executing their tasks, keeping
themselves alive and less likely to get stuck.
- Re-enabled multiplayer campaign.
- New alien ruin art.
- New main menu (still a work in progress).
- New fonts.
- New subs and a new shuttle.
- New husk sprites.
- Improved item/character highlight effect.
- New signal items (divide, multiply, subtract, memory, equals, greater than, color, xor).
- Option to adjust microphone volume in multiplayer.
- Added a console commands for changing the gender and race of the character.
- More intuitive BrokenSprite condition logic: a BrokenSprite with a MaxCondition of 50 will start
fading in at 50 (and be fully visible when the condition drops to 0 or down to the MaxCondition of
the next BrokenSprite).
- Added Mirror X/Y buttons to editing HUDs and tooltips that tell about the keyboard shortcuts.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Improved item position syncing logic. Less warping or items being impossible to pick up due to
being in a different position server-side.
- Fixed clients not sending a network update to the server when dragging an item out of an inventory
slot, causing situations such as suffocation after dropping a diving suit due to the server not
knowing that you'd dropped it.
- The client hosting a server and spectators don't trigger autorestart.
- The owner of a server is allowed to spectate even if spectating is disallowed in server settings.
- Fixed "play yourself" always toggling to true when a round ends.
- Fixed missing item names in the extra cargo menu.
- Fixed traitor rounds failing to start if the server is not hosted by a client.
- Fixed console command aliases not being taken into account in GameClient.HasConsoleCommandPermission
(meaning that the client needed a permission for each name variant of a command, making it impossible
to for example use "fixwalls" instead of "fixhulls").
- Made the "control" console command usable to clients.
- Show the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby even if the client has the permission to start
the round.
- Fixed server lobby screen not showing the names of the submarines the client doesn't have.
- Fixed inability to select the respawn shuttle as a client host.
- Fixed VoipCapture creating new "could not start voice capture" popups constantly if there's no
suitable capture device.
- Fixed crashing when starting a round if a submarine name contains underscores.
- Fixed clients console errors when attempting to modify the properties of an ItemComponent in-game
(for example, the color of a light component).
- Added some more information to the console messages and error popups when a client gets disconnected.
- Fixed enablecheats command crashing the server if it's used when there are no clients present.

Misc bugfixes:
- Audio fixes (less snap, crackle and pop).
- Fixed particle "jitter" when the submarine was moving fast.
- Fixed damage modifiers affecting all afflictions if they use affliction types instead of affliction
identifiers.
- Fixed end round vote text going outside the screen if there's a 2-digit amount of votes.
- Fixed StatusEffects only applying afflictions to one limb even if the target is "Character" instead of "Limb".
- Disable audio instead of crashing if no audio device is found.
- Fixed item interfaces getting repositioned every frame when the editing HUD is open.
- Fixed held items clipping with the sleeves of the character (e.g. when holding a revolver while an
uniform is equipped).
- Fixed being able to levitate by spamming the ragdoll button.
- Fixed dead characters draining oxygen tanks inside diving suits/masks.
- Fixed reactor gauges getting messed up if the optimal fission rate is more than 100% (which may happen
if the power consumption is larger than what the reactor can generate).
- Fixed mud raptors not having an inventory (nor lootable items).
- Fixed inability to interact with any items when aim assist is set to 0%.
- Fixed info panel flickering out and Tab getting "inverted" (= info panel shown when tab is not being held)
when selecting crew members in the panel.
- Fixed characters arms occasionally getting stuck above their shoulders.
- Fixed wire nodes occasionally being created at the wrong end of a wire (e.g. when moving a wire between
connections in a connection panel, the wire stretched from the device at the other end of the wire to
the device that's being rewired).

Misc:
- Changed the way arguments are given to the "setclientcharacter" command (no semicolon to separate the
names, quotation marks have to be used for multi-word names just like with any other command).
- Show the amount of credits in the crew tab of the campaign menu.
- Don't spawn new monsters if docked to the start outpost or within 50 meters of the start/end of the level.
- The diving knife now causes also internal damage besides bleeding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:
- Fixed alien vents crashing the game when there's a character nearby.
- Fixed chatbox retaining the radio message prefix after being deselected.
- Push-to-talk doesn't trigger when typin in a text box.
- Fixed some server log messages and texts sent to clients being incorrect (= showing the tags that are
used to fetch the texts from the language files instead of the actual texts).
- Fixed AI orders that target a specific item (such as the order to power up the reactor) not working in
multiplayer.
- Fixed crashes when attempting to use voice capture or change voice capture settings when there are no
suitable capture devices available.
- Fixed clients not being notified when an AI character shuts down the reactor.
- Fixed deconstructors staying active without power in multiplayer.
- Fixed sonar labels going outside the screen when at the left side of the display.

Additions & changes:
- Added some supplies to vanilla submarines.
- Balanced item deterioration rates and adjusted neutral ballast settings in vanilla subs.
- Increased the impact tolerance of crawlers to prevent them from killing themselves by bumping into walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer improvements:
- Got rid of the listen server: when hosting as a client, the game actually runs the dedicated server executable
in the background. Makes client-hosted servers a little smoother due to the better performance of the dedicated
server, and also makes it much easier for us to maintain and test the multiplayer because we no longer have
two separate server applications.
- Added multiplayer campaign.
- VOIP support! Still a work in progress, so minor audio glitches are to be expected.
- Improved character and submarine position syncing. Way less rubberbanding and teleporting!
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when autorestarting or starting by voting.
- Fixes players being unable to log in as a client when they're hosting a dedicated server on another machine.
- Option to randomize your job preferences in the server lobby.
- Fixed a server timing issue that occasionally caused the server to kick clients due to desync when a round starts.
- Fixed occasional server-side "maximum packet size exceeded" errors.
- Require the players to either dock with the ending outpost or to get the sub close and enter the outpost before
automatically ending the round.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing if the round ends while the health window is open.
- Fixed incorrect item panel positioning in the crew command interface when the sub is docked to something.
- Fixed crashing when an incompatible content package is selected in config.xml or if the content package
cannot be found.
- Fixed screen distortion effects on Linux.
- Fixed non-character key input on Linux (arrow keys, tab, etc).
- Fixed fullscreen option not taking effect on game launch.
- Fixes to a bunch of crashes in the character editor.
- Fixed subinventories not being displayed on the inner clothes slot, making it impossible to use the extra
slots in uniforms.
- Fixed game settings resetting every time the game is updated.
- Fixed bots shooting at their own crew with turrets.
- Fixed wifi components not receiving chat messages in single player.
- Fixed AI not reloading coilguns if an empty box of ammunition is inserted in the loader.
- Fixed incorrect deusizine scale.
- Fixed turret light toggle not doing anything.
- Fixed character skills that aren't defined in the job xml never increasing, resulting in all jobs except
the captain always having a helm skill of 0.
- Fixed flashlight & scooter light cones being "clipped".
- Fixed StatusEffects bypassing limb damage modifiers.
- Fixed waypoints not getting connected between docking ports on some subs.
- Fixed target identifiers being bypassed when a StatusEffect is set to target nearby items or characters.
- Fixed the "insufficient skills to use the item" text popping up if a character doesn't have sufficient
skills to operate one of the item's components, even if the component was not interacted with (e.g. captains
got a warning about not being able to use the connection panel of a nav terminal, even if they didn't select
the connection panel).

Steam Workshop:
- Update installed workshop items automatically on startup.
- Allow adding submarines to workshop items with the "add file" dialog.
- If creating an update for a workshop item that's currently installed, use the installed version instead
of the one downloaded from the workshop.

Additions:
- Some new random events.
- A bunch of new afflictions and medical items.
- Some new item sprites.
- A couple of new cargo missions.
- Added some new items that can be crafted from alien materials.
- Display linked hulls as one room on the status monitor.
- Tons of new sound effects.
- Display the controlled character in the crew interface.
- Option to "give orders" to the character you're controlling. In single player it can be useful if you want
the controlled character to keep doing something when switching to another one, in the multiplayer it can be
used to let others know what you're doing.
- Added a weak spot to Moloch's bladder.
- Baby Moloch, doo doo doo doo doo doo
- Added damage particles to Mud Raptors and Molochs.
- Added "minimum velocity" property to to motion sensors. Allows making sensors that, for example, keep a door open
when a character is standing in the doorway.
- Option to choose whether to use AND/OR logic in StatusEffects with multiple conditionals. Defaults to AND.
- Added a 1 second "cooldown" to water detector state switches to prevent alarms from toggling on and off constantly
when the water level is fluctuating around the position of the detector.
- Added scram option (reactor shutdown) to the nav consoles in the vanilla subs.
- Support for binding Mouse4, Mouse5 and MouseWheel.
- Made Hammerhead and Mudraptor attracted to light.
- New husk sprite (still WIP).

Misc:
- Decreased deterioration rates across the board. Repairing a damaged item to full condition also now resets
the deterioration delay, meaning that the item will not start deteriorating again immediately after it's been
repaired.
- Miscellaneous optimization.
- Removed the info button from the top-left corner - the info menu is now opened with TAB.
- Changed default chat/radio keybinds to T and Y.
- Welding tools repair all the walls within the range of the raycast, not just the first wall the raycast hits.
Makes it easier to repair overlapping and multi-layered walls.
- Decreased the range of passive sonar - previously there was often no reason to use the active sonar because
the passive mode showed the area around the sub so clearly.
- Health scanner shows all active afflictions (not just those that are visible in the health interface).
Allows detecting afflictions at an earlier stage, making the item much more useful.
- Nerfed the structure damage done by Molochs and Crawlers.
- Reduced creature HP across the board.
- Increased the amount of minerals in levels.
- Increased flare burn time, making them more useful as path markers during exploration of ruins.

that always does burn damage.
- Made headsets craftable.
- Battery output doesn't start dropping until the charge is below 10%.
- Restrict the amount of power going through relay components to the MaxPower value of the relay.
- Set Humpback reactor output a bit higher, batteries now start at full charge and relays can't be overloaded.
- Miscellaneous fixes and balancing to vanilla subs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

instead of "file123 (2).txt").
- Fixed battery positioning in charging docks.
- Fixed crashing when ending a single player round while a character is outside the sub.
- Fixed "attempting to remove an already removed item" console errors when ending a round.
- Fixed fire sounds persisting in menus.
- Fixed the layout of the extra cargo menu in server settings.
- Fixed depth charges disappearing from loaders when interacting them with both hand slots full.
- Fixed StatusEffects not being able to target item components. Caused doors to be impossible to weld
and most likely other issues with item StatusEffects as well.
- Artifacts spawn in artifact holders again.
- Fixes to "attempted to move pulljoint extremely far" errors which occasionally caused severe problems
in syncing characters' positions.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused monsters to spawn very close to the submarine in monster missions.
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when automatically starting the game via
autorestart or clients being ready.
- Fixed up-to-date content packages being reported as incompatible in the Steam workshop menu.
- Changed the default radio chat hotkey to T.

than what the reactor can generate. Caused "failed to write an event for the entity" errors in multiplayer.
- Fixed AI characters attempting to treat dead characters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.1 (closed alpha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too many changes to list here. :) We've been working on this update for a year now, with a team of about
a dozen people (as opposed to a couple of devs working on it on their free time).

Almost every aspect of the game has been improved to some extent - some polished a bit, some went through
a more major overhaul and many things are completely new.

This is by no means a complete list, but here's some of the new things:

- A full graphics overhaul: almost all of the sprites has been polished or completely remade.
- Improved random event system that tries to keep the overall difficulty of the game at certain level,
delaying additional monster spawns if there's already lots of things going on, or spawning more when
there's a more quiet moment.
- Improved difficulty system: now the difficulty level has a much more noticeable effect on the gameplay.
- General difficulty balancing all across the board: we've tried to make the difficulty curve more approachable
to new players while still keeping things challenging for more experienced players on higher difficulty levels.
- More varied levels, environmental hazards.
- A new more detailed health system with things such as limb-specific injuries, addictions, overdoses,
mental issues... The system is also highly moddable, and makes it much easier to implement things such as
hunger mechanics, more varied poisons or stat-boosting items.
- Completely redesigned in-game HUD (the inventory, crew command interface, chat, etc).
- Redesigned crafting system.
- Minerals scattered across the level (can be used for crafting).
- A command/report system that can be used to communicate with your crew more effectively (in both single
player and multiplayer).
- Tons of additions to alien ruins (traps, puzzles, non-flooded rooms).
- Improved AI (both the crew AI and the enemy AIs).
- NPC dialog (including random chatter and context-specific lines that make it easier to keep track of
what the crew is doing).
- Most of the device interfaces have been redesigned to make them easier to use (and nicer to look at!).
- Many additions to the campaign mode (still a work in progress though).
- Overhauled the skill system: now every character can generally do anything (repair devices, fabricate
new items, apply medical treatments), but characters with higher skill levels will do things more efficiently.
- Skill progression in the campaign mode: characters' skills gradually increase, making them more valuable with
each completed round.
- New music composed specifically for the game.
- Overhauled audio.
- New monsters.
- New items (weapons, tools, medical items, alien items, crafting materials, etc).
- A completely remade tutorial.
- Too many bugfixes to count.
- Improved and much more stable ragdoll animations.
- Additional tools for modders (character editor, sprite editor, level editor, additions to the submarine editor).
- Steam functionality of course: full Workshop support, achievements, banning Steam IDs from servers...
- Improved translation support: it's possible to translate texts in item/job/etc configuration files without
breaking compatibility with existing subs or mods (see the EnglishVanilla file for some instructions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clients can now join servers that have an IPv6 address.
- Added "unban" and "unbanip" commands.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to apply an invalid force/impulse to a physics body"
errors.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to move a pulljoint extremely far" errors.
- Fixed DebugConsole selecting non-command lines if up/down is pressed when there are no commands in the
console.
- Fixed inventory syncing not working on the controlled character's inventory if the character is
unconscious or wearing handcuffs.
- Verify that the launched exe belongs to the currently selected content package when starting up the game.
- Fixed console messages that have been created before initializing the debug console not being present
in crash logs. Made it difficult to diagnose crashes that occur immediately when the game starts.
- Additional error logging to diagnose SharpDX errors on startup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.
- Fixed conditionals being ignored on delayed status effects.
- Fixed clients staying in an unsynced state if they rejoin while their character is dead or unconscious,
causing the camera not to follow the character and preventing the player from giving up.
- Fixed LightComponent sprites and broken device sprites not being mirrored in mirrored subs.
- Fixed a few ragdoll animation bugs that caused "attempted to move pulljoint anchor extremely far" errors.
- Fixed AI characters (most often mantises) being able to attack through walls.
- Fixed alien ruins occasionally overlapping with each other or being above the upper boundary of the level.
- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs.
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).
- Fixed characters occasionally getting teleported outside the sub for a few frames when moving between
docked subs.
- Fixed status effects that deplete oxygen affecting characters that don't need air to breathe.
- More error logging to diagnose syncing errors.
- Melee weapons can only hit one character per swing (makes stun batons and medical syringes less OP).
- Option to make RegEx component only send a signal when it receives a signal (not continuously according
to the last received signal).
- Added FalseOutput property to RegEx components.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Husks or huskified humans don't gain health by attacking corpses.
- Fixed dragged characters occasionally getting launched away at a high speed when moving from sub to
another.
- Fixed dragged characters staying floating mid-air after they've been dragged up/down ladders.
- Attempt to fix items occasionally dropping client-side when moving them from an inventory to another.
- Fixed incorrect rotation of welding tools and other 2-handed items that are held in one hand when not
aiming. The items were rotated according to the left hand, but positioned on the right hand.
- Spaces and exclamation marks are allowed in client names by default.
- Hitscan weapons like the revolver can hit targets outside the sub when firing from the inside and
vice versa.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone linked submarines in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone items with non-default required items.
- Fixed autopilot being unable to navigate to the destination in mirrored levels.
- Ragdolls can't be dragged through walls or other colliders.
- Dropped flashlights don't consume and battery and turn off automatically.
- Oxygenite tanks can be stored in cabinets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Networking additions:
	- Added a server setting for selecting which symbols are allowed in client names (see
	AllowedClientNameChars in the server settings file).
	- Custom servers can modify all editable item properties mid-round, not just in-game editable ones.
	- Clients can be given access to server logs.
	- Respawn durations can be changed mid-round.
	- Servers have the option to disable the disguise feature.
	- Increased midround syncing timeout.

Misc changes:
	- Levels are mirrored when travelling through the backwards in the campaign mode.
	- Added colliders to railguns (so they cannot go through walls or enemy subs anymore).
	- Melee weapons can hit multiple targets on one swing. Fixes weapons occasionally  not hitting
	the target in tight spaces due to touching the ceiling/walls first.
	- The voltage required for a PowerTransfer item to take damage and the probability for a fire can be
	configured in the item xmls.
	- Docking ports and hatches aren't damaged by excess voltage.
	- Added more color variants of wires.
	- Characters point the harpoon gun down when not aiming.
	- Added parameter autocompletion to the kill command.
	- Added a property that can be used to lock connection panels but still keep the panel rewireable
	in the submarine editor.
	- Items outside the sub cannot be deattached from walls.
	- Fabricators show the list of required items even if the character does not have the skills to craft
	the item.

Networking bugfixes:
	- Fixed file transfers failing if the client disconnects during an active transfer, rejoins and
	attempts to receive the same file.
	- Fixed a bug in door syncing that caused the door states to differ between the server and clients
	in some	subs with more complex door wiring setups.
	- Fixed clients being able to spam kick votes (duplicate votes were not counted but caused unnecessary
	chat messages to be sent).
	- Fixed item conditions occasionally not matching exactly between the server and clients, causing
	issues such as not clients not being able to fabricate items due to the condition being slightly
	below the minimum condition at their end.

Bugfixes:
	- Added a workaround to a MonoGame bug that makes the screen turn white when alt-tabbing out of fullscreen.
	- Fixed docking ports flooding for no reason in some custom subs.
	- Fixed LightComponents staying active on broken items.
	- Fixed railguns and depth charge tubes being directly usable by characters (= they could be launched
	simply by selecting them and left clicking, without the need to use a railgun controller).
	- Fixed items salvaged from ruins not being saved in the campaign mode.
	- Fixed LOS effect being brighter than the ambient light in some of the darker levels, causing

- Nerfed wall damage. Crawlers, mantises, threshers and coelanths now take much more time to tear through
the hull and collisions with the level cause less damage.

Items:
	- Added syringe guns and a bunch of new chemicals.

	- Option to determine which types of targets a projectile can stick to.
	- Improved revolver hitscan logic.
	- Item descriptions can be changed in the submarine editor.
	- Characters can hold flashlights in their mouths.
	- Added an inventory slot for ID cards.

	show the name that's in the ID card the character is wearing.
	- The owner of an ID card is stated in the description of the card.
	- Fabricating items requires the ingredients to have a specific minimum condition (can't use
	already-used consumables to craft something).
	- Deconstructing an item that's not in a full condition may prevent some deconstruction products from appearing.
	- Optimized electricity/signal logic.
	- Grenades can be triggered by detonators.
	- Bought cargo spawns in containers instead of being scattered across the floor.

	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

Multiplayer additions:
	- Added an optional "karma system". Harming other players, damaging structures and blowing up the reactor
	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players
	from choosing specific jobs

	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	secretly identify other traitors.
	- Added an option to make players spawn directly in the main submarine instead of the respawn shuttle.

	- Added a [PM] tag to private chat messages.
	- Fixed game over/round end music not playing when a round ends.

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.

	- Fixed anti-husk medicine being able to reduce husk infection state after the infection has reached
	the active state.
	- Fixed monsters being able to spawn right next to the spawnpoint of the sub.
	- Fixed hulls not being linked to gaps if the center of the gap is exactly at the edge of the adjacent
	hulls.
	- Miscellaneous crew AI fixes.
	- Fixes to fast projectiles going through walls.
	- Fixed structure damage sounds not being played when a structure is fully destroyed.
	- Fixed glass windows using wrong sound effects.
	- Fixed carrier's light falling off when it dies.
	- Fixed incorrect positioning of debug console question prompts.
	- Fixed being able to use a wrench on multiple items at the same time.
	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections
	to go through doors which prevented AI characters from opening them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.

- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters
invulnerable to small amounts of damage.
- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

	- Minor particle optimizations.

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed the "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED" crashes on specific GPUs when the loading reaches 80%.
	- Fixed crashes when projectiles stuck to items on dedicated server.

	a character turns into a husk).
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused swimming creatures to flip around constantly.
	- Fixed a bug that caused creatures to be able to sever limb joints that shouldn't be possible to sever,
	causing issues when attempting to sync the positions of the dead bodies.

v0.6.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.

on the top 3 preferences of a client (which can happen on modded servers that have several jobs with a
player limit).
- Fixed errors during job assignment if a client or the host is controlling a non-human character.
- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed null reference exceptions when syncing docking ports that haven't been docked to anything.
- Fixed invisible diving suits in some of the respawn shuttles (specifically ones where the suits spawn
directly on the floor).

- Tab doesn't autoselect the chatbox when the debug console is open.
- Fixed missing kick/ban buttons in the crew menu.
- Fixed a bug that caused ID mismatches in the hulls between docking ports. This caused, for example,
mysterious client-side fires around docking ports and "unknown object header" errors.

Misc:
	- Improved item interaction logic: highlighting items is more precise, with items directly under
	the cursor taking priority.

	- New blood particles.
	- Blood, explosion and fire decals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Readded spam filter.
- Servers log the automatic temperature control setting of nuclear reactors.
- If a client fails to start a round (due to a missing sub file or an error, for example), their character

v0.5.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for multiple submarines (no full-fledged submarine vs submarine battles yet, but they're coming
in future updates!):
	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)
	- fixed monster inventory syncing (i.e. husk inventory syncing)
	- fixed server description box not being synced with clients
	- search bar for server logs
	- more server options
	- fixed the occasional "queue empty" error messages when attempting to send submarine files to players
	- characters can't be freely named anymore - they'll have the same name as the client

Items:
	- items can be equipped/unequipped by double clicking
	- longer railgun view distance
	- changes to the logic that determines which item is being highlighted - now it's much easier to
	select specific items in cramped subs
	- highlighted items glow (so it's easier to see which item you're targeting in the dark)
	- fixed an electricity bug that sometimes caused parts of the grid to not carry any power after
	a junction box has been broken and repaired
	- option to choose the output of a signal check component when the signal doesn't match
	- fixed fire extinquishers
	- item search bar in the submarine editor

	- fixed flashes from explosions/sparks/flares occasionally ''staying on''
	- cameras: can be connected to a railgun controller (or any other selectable controller) to remotely
	view rooms or areas around the sub

Submarines:
	- the mass of a submarine depends on its size - larger submarines require more force to move around
	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)
	- changes to depth damage logic: structures with more health need more pressure before they start taking
	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:

	recalculating them every frame)

	empty/fill the hull they're inside
