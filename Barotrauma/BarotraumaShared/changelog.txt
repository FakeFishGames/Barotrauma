v0.8.9.1 (closed alpha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too many changes to list here. :) We've been working on this update for a year now, with a team of about 
a dozen people (as opposed to a couple of devs working on it on their free time).

Almost every aspect of the game has been improved to some extent - some polished a bit, some went through 
a more major overhaul and many things are completely new.

This is by no means a complete list, but here's some of the new things:

- A full graphics overhaul: almost all of the sprites has been polished or completely remade.
- Improved random event system that tries to keep the overall difficulty of the game at certain level,
delaying additional monster spawns if there's already lots of things going on, or spawning more when 
there's a more quiet moment.
- Improved difficulty system: now the difficulty level has a much more noticeable effect on the gameplay.
- General difficulty balancing all across the board: we've tried to make the difficulty curve more approachable
to new players while still keeping things challenging for more experienced players on higher difficulty levels.
- More varied levels, environmental hazards.
- A new more detailed health system with things such as limb-specific injuries, addictions, overdoses, 
mental issues... The system is also highly moddable, and makes it much easier to implement things such as
hunger mechanics, more varied poisons or stat-boosting items.
- Completely redesigned in-game HUD (the inventory, crew command interface, chat, etc).
- Redesigned crafting system.
- Minerals scattered across the level (can be used for crafting).
- A command/report system that can be used to communicate with your crew more effectively (in both single 
player and multiplayer).
- Tons of additions to alien ruins (traps, puzzles, non-flooded rooms).
- Improved AI (both the crew AI and the enemy AIs).
- NPC dialog (including random chatter and context-specific lines that make it easier to keep track of 
what the crew is doing).
- Most of the device interfaces have been redesigned to make them easier to use (and nicer to look at!).
- Many additions to the campaign mode (still a work in progress though).
- Overhauled the skill system: now every character can generally do anything (repair devices, fabricate 
new items, apply medical treatments), but characters with higher skill levels will do things more efficiently.
- Skill progression in the campaign mode: characters' skills gradually increase, making them more valuable with 
each completed round.
- New music composed specifically for the game.
- Overhauled audio.
- New monsters.
- New items (weapons, tools, medical items, alien items, crafting materials, etc).
- A completely remade tutorial.
- Too many bugfixes to count.
- Improved and much more stable ragdoll animations.
- Additional tools for modders (character editor, sprite editor, level editor, additions to the submarine editor).
- Steam functionality of course: full Workshop support, achievements, banning Steam IDs from servers...
- Improved translation support: it's possible to translate texts in item/job/etc configuration files without
breaking compatibility with existing subs or mods (see the EnglishVanilla file for some instructions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.

- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs. 
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the 
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass 
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with 
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).
- Fixed characters occasionally getting teleported outside the sub for a few frames when moving between 
docked subs.
- Fixed status effects that deplete oxygen affecting characters that don't need air to breathe.
- More error logging to diagnose syncing errors.

- Hitscan weapons like the revolver can hit targets outside the sub when firing from the inside and 
vice versa.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone linked submarines in the sub editor.

- Characters can fall through holes in floors.
- Players can pick up corpses and eat them when controlling a monster.
- Husks don't attack huskified humans.
- Characters with severed limbs cannot be resurrected as a husk.
- The humanhusk.xml config file is found based on the name instead of the file path, making it possible
to use a custom config file without modifying the original one.
- More footstep sound variety.
- More gore particles!
- Added a conditional system to status effects. Allows creating status effects that only have an effect
when a specific condition is met (e.g. health above a specific level, charge of an item high enough).
- Option to prevent status effects from stacking.
- Option to make status effects cancel other status effects.

Items:
	- Added syringe guns and a bunch of new chemicals.
	- Added ducts, switches and motion detectors.
	- Added crowbars (can be used to open locked doors).
	- Chemicals and explosives can be thrown.
	- Made more items craftable and deconstructable.
	- Added sprites for broken doors, hatches and junction boxes.
	- Health Scanner HUD displays causes of death.
	- Health Scanner HUD only shows the status of the visible character that the cursor is closest to 
	prevent multiple characters from cluttering the screen
	- Added "smallitem" tag to revolver rounds (can be placed in cabinets and pockets now).
	- Option to determine which types of targets a projectile can stick to.
	- Improved revolver hitscan logic.
	- Item descriptions can be changed in the submarine editor.
	- Characters can hold flashlights in their mouths.
	- Added an inventory slot for ID cards.
	- If a character is wearing an item that obscures their face, the game will either hide their name or
	show the name that's in the ID card the character is wearing. 
	- The owner of an ID card is stated in the description of the card.
	- Fabricating items requires the ingredients to have a specific minimum condition (can't use 
	already-used consumables to craft something).
	- Deconstructing an item that's not in a full condition may prevent some deconstruction products from appearing.
	- Optimized electricity/signal logic.
	- Grenades can be triggered by detonators.
	- Bought cargo spawns in containers instead of being scattered across the floor.
	- Players can't use other items when a railgun controller is selected. Prevents accidentally firing 
	weapons or hitting people with something while using the railguns.
	- Item editing menus display color values as 0-255 instead of 0-1.
	- Reactor temperature has to be critical for 30 seconds before the reactor explodes, giving the crew 
	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output 
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

Multiplayer additions:
	- Added an optional "karma system". Harming other players, damaging structures and blowing up the reactor 
	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players 
	from choosing specific jobs
	- Clients can be given permission to use specific console commands.
	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	secretly identify other traitors.
	- Added an option to make players spawn directly in the main submarine instead of the respawn shuttle.
	- Keybinds are disabled when the chatbox is active. Now it's possible to use normal letter/number keys
	as the chat hotkey without accidentally deselecting the chatbox by typing a message.
	- Chat hotkey can also be used in the server lobby.
	- Added a [PM] tag to private chat messages.
	- Fixed game over/round end music not playing when a round ends.
	- Cutting and repairing walls is included in server logs.

Multiplayer bugfixes:
	- Fixed clients getting disconnected due to desync when a new monster is spawned mid-round by 
	a repeating	monster event.
	- Fixed modified clients being able to chat while unconscious due to the lack of server-side checks.
	- Fixed modified clients being able to disconnect locked wires due to the lack of server-side checks.
	- Fixed chat messages being assigned to the wrong sender when their bodies have been eaten.
	- Fixed crashing when setting a server filter while the game is refreshing the server list.

	to their inventory first.
	- Fixed 5th server being impossible to select in the server list.
	- Improvements to character position syncing.
	- Re-enabled logic for preventing players from using visually similar names.
	- Fixed client-side null exception when the client is in the lobby and a round ends with the mission 
	successfully completed.
	- Fixed clients being able to votekick/kick/ban themselves in the server lobby.
	- Fixed "selected mode" and "mission type" settings not being saved.
	- Level seed randomization can be toggled on and off via the debug console.
	- Fixed dedicated server not randomizing the submarine or game mode even if randomization is enabled.
	- Lighting is forced back on when a client starts a round (-> can't disable lighting by using the 
	console command before joining a server).

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.
	- Messagebox overflow fixes.
	- Fixed status effects not being able to decrease stun timers.
	- Fixed anti-husk medicine being able to reduce husk infection state after the infection has reached
	the active state.
	- Fixed monsters being able to spawn right next to the spawnpoint of the sub.
	- Fixed hulls not being linked to gaps if the center of the gap is exactly at the edge of the adjacent
	hulls.
	- Miscellaneous crew AI fixes.
	- Fixes to fast projectiles going through walls.
	- Fixed structure damage sounds not being played when a structure is fully destroyed.
	- Fixed glass windows using wrong sound effects.
	- Fixed carrier's light falling off when it dies.
	- Fixed incorrect positioning of debug console question prompts.
	- Fixed being able to use a wrench on multiple items at the same time.
	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections 
	to go through doors which prevented AI characters from opening them.
	- Fixed modified structure colors not being cloned.
	- Fixed modified wall colors only being visible in the submarine editor.
	- Fixed items being dropped when attempting to place them in an itemcontainer slot that's on a normal 
	inventory slot.

	- Fixed submarine editor crashing when attempting to use illegal characters in the filename.
	- Mouse clicks have to be <10 pixels apart to be considered a double click.
	- Fixed subinventory slots going outside the screen when highlighting an item such as a metal crate.
	- All creatures all cleared from the tutorial level to prevent any unintended monster attacks.
	- Fixed "constructing final path failed" pathfinding errors.
	- Fixed particles going through closed gaps (e.g. closed doors).
	- Fixed submarines being able to enter ruins.
	- Fixed collisions between a sub and the ruins not causing any damage to either the sub or the ruins.
	- Whitespace is ignored when calculating MD5 hashes for files.

v0.7.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.
- Fixed content package setting not being saved in the settings menu.
- Item pickup sounds are only played when the controlled character picks up an item.
- Removed serverconfig.xml (the dedicated server now uses the same config file as the normal game).
- Updated the vanilla content package to version 0.7.
- Fixed entity linking in the submarine editor.
- Fixed railgun HUD crashing the game if the railgun is linked to an item that does not have an 
ItemContainer component (i.e. any item that can't contain other items).

- Fixed crashes when attempting to use a railgun controller that's not connected to anything.
- Fixed autorestart counter overlapping with the campaign map in the server lobby screen.
- Fixed characters receiving damage almost exclusively to their feet when wearing a diving suit.
- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters
invulnerable to small amounts of damage.
- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Multiplayer campaign mode!

Level changes:
	- Added ocean floors and hydrothermal vents.

	- Minor particle optimizations.

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed the "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED" crashes on specific GPUs when the loading reaches 80%.
	- Fixed crashes when projectiles stuck to items on dedicated server.

	a character turns into a husk).
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused swimming creatures to flip around constantly.
	- Fixed a bug that caused creatures to be able to sever limb joints that shouldn't be possible to sever,
	causing issues when attempting to sync the positions of the dead bodies.
	- Fixed vote count texts persisting in the server lobby after the host disables voting.
	- Fixed newly joined clients not receiving the latest voting status until someone votes for something.
	- Fixed vote count texts not being updated after a client disconnects and their vote is removed.

	- Fixed AI characters never making any sounds in multiplayer.
	- Fixed inability to rebind keys to Mouse2 via the settings menu.
	- Fixed destroyed doors being impossible to repair.
	- Fixed creatures seeking towards an incorrect position when trying to eat something (causing larger 
	creatures like threshers and coelanths to swim around the target without ever reaching it).

Items:

	- Sounds for picking up and dropping items.
	- Medical scanner displays husk infections.
	- New C4, detonator and grenade sprites.
	- Optimizations and minor visual changes to the sonar display.
	- Support for hitscan projectiles.
	- Fixed ranged weapons launching projectiles with an incorrect rotation.
	- The spread of ranged weapons can be adjusted (separate values for normal spread and spread when 
	the item is being used by a character with an inadequate skill level).
	- Heavier harpoon gun recoil and impulse when the spear hits something.

- Improved item editing UI:
	- Number input fields for numeric values.
	- Separate number input fields for the components of vector values (instead of one text input box)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.

- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific 
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the 
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed hulls not being rendered in the submarine editor.
- Crouching is synced between the server and the clients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed diving suits and masks not providing enough oxygen when in a low-oxygen room or outside the submarine.
- Fixed message boxes being impossible to close in the launcher.

Misc:
	- Improved item interaction logic: highlighting items is more precise, with items directly under 
	the cursor taking priority.
	- Characters can be dismembered by creatures and explosions.
	- New blood particles.
	- Blood, explosion and fire decals.
	- Added an artifact that attracts creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Readded spam filter.
- Servers log the automatic temperature control setting of nuclear reactors.
- If a client fails to start a round (due to a missing sub file or an error, for example), their character

	hide from enemies.
	- new sonar visuals
	- texts in labels can be resized
	- alien weapons can be used as railgun ammo
	- nerfed oxygen and welding fuel tank explosions

	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)

	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)

	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:
	- stunned characters can't move items in their inventory
	- characters can run while grabbing/dragging someone
	- fixed a bug that made it impossible to spawn characters through the console in the Linux version
