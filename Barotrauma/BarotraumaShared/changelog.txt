v0.9.7.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI/UX improvements:
- Double clicking on an item moves it to the equipped inventory (e.g. ammo to the equipped weapon).
- Periscopes can be deselected by pressing esc.
- Fabricators can pull ingredients directly from the user's inventory without having to place them in the fabricator's input slots.
- Lock the on/off slider in the pump interface when the state is controlled by signals, same with the engine slider.
- 1 second cooldown before doors can be opened/closed after someone else has opened/closed them. Makes it less likely for doors to be opened/closed accidentally when multiple people are trying to use them at the same time. 
- Show a warning if trying to start a campaign for the first time without playing the tutorials.
- Diving suits and fire extinguishers are not automatically picked up from the lockers/brackets when clicking on them to make it less likely to accidentally pick them up. Instead, clicking on them opens the inventory of the container, the same way when interacting with e.g. a steel cabinet.
- Subinventories (= inventories inside items, toolboxes for example) open/close faster and cannot be interacted with until fully open.
- Contents of toolboxes and crates are shown in the tooltip when hovering the cursor over the slot.
- In-game message boxes (mission/traitor notifications) close automatically after 15 seconds if not interacted with.
- Right-clicking in the sub editor opens a context menu that can be used to remove, cut, copy and paste entities (making it possible to remove them when using a keyboard that doesn't have a delete key).
- Hide cursor when aiming with a turret or a ranged weapon.
- Hide inventory when operating a turret.
- Added filtering to sprite and particle editors.
- Added a "Decorative" category to the submarine editor.
- Made docking indicators more visible on the sonar.
- Show mic input level also when Push-to-Talk mode is selected to make it easier to adjust the level without having to switch the mode to Voice Activity.

Optimization:
- Major physics optimization. Most importantly, the physics are now multithreaded, making the game perform much better when there are large numbers of characters active.
- Item optimizations. Items that don't currently have any components active are not updated, which significantly improves the performance especially in large subs with lots of items.
- More aggressive character culling (characters stop being rendered as soon as they exit the camera view).
- Dead bodies despawn after a few minutes (or when the character respawns in multiplayer). The despawning character's items are placed in a duffel bag and dropped near the body. Prevents performance issues when lots of bodies start to accumulate in the submarine.
- Preload necessary monster assets at the start of the round to prevent lag spikes when a monster spawns.

Additions and changes:
- New shuttle, "Hemulen".
- Merged Selkie and Bunyip into a new, improved shuttle (just called Selkie now).
- The job gear variants are not just visually different versions of the same item, but completely separate items. The job variants now allow the players to choose what kind of gear they want to spawn with, not just the look of the uniform.
- Attachable items and wire nodes can now be freely placed around the character instead of always being placed at the position of the character. When attaching items/wires, there's a placement grid that makes it much easier to neatly attach/wire things mid-round.
- The submarines now get automatically outfitted with a semi-random selection of supplies when starting a campaign. The items that have been manually placed in the submarine editor are kept as-is.
- Added a keyboard item that can be used to send and display textual signals. Could be used for things such as terminals that send commands to devices or display some data received from devices.
- Added muzzle flashes to small firearms.
- Added a crosshair when aiming with small firearms. The crosshair also indicates the spread of the weapon.
- Increased the skill requirements to operate the reactor.
- New background music for editors.
- Characters with an insufficient electrical engineering skill may get electrocuted when rewiring powered devices.
- Added holes in the level walls next to the outpost at the end of the level, so the player doesn't have to backtrack through most of the level if they approach the outpost from the wrong side of the level wall.
- Added heavy water currents at the sides of the level to make it more obvious that you're not supposed to go that way.
- Added subtle chromatic aberration & blur when suffering from heavy bloodloss.
- Nerfed hull damage from plasma cutter and welding tool explosions.
- Removed repair thresholds from items; any device that's not in perfect condition can now be repaired.
- Bandages now have 3 uses.
- Mouse button names are now translated.
- Improved tiger thresher sprite.
- Replaced the legacy ladder, stair and docking port sprites.
- New alarm buzzer sprite that actually looks like an alarm buzzer.
- New (smaller) small pump sprite.
- Decreased the range and brightness of the "halo" around the players.
- Exposed pump's MaxFlow parameter in the sub editor.
- Added a lot more oomph to nuclear explosions.

AI:
- Bots can now undock the sub.
- TODO: expand

Multiplayer:
- Fixed players not getting notified in any way when they connection to the server has timed out, allowing them to keep playing without being able to interact with anything.
- Fixed clients not attempting to reconnect to the server automatically when if the connection is lost, forcing the client to rejoin the server manually.
- Karma system can be enabled/disabled in the "host server" menu.
- Option the set the number of password retries before a ban.
- Fixed voice chat indicators not working in the in-game crew list.
- Moved "End Round" button to the pause menu.
- Added a separate server log category for wiring.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed camera position "twitching" when moving the cursor around while unconscious.
- Fixed texts in mission/traitor notifications occasionally overflowing outside the border of the message box.
- Fixed background structures that are resizeable on both axes always being drawn behind other background structures regardless of the sprite depth.
- Fixed Kastrull flooding when the drone undocks.
- Fixed sonar transducers consuming no power.
- Fixed charactes being unable to get through multi-layer walls from inside the sub (for example the walls above Humpback's command room).
- Fixed plasma cutter not cutting through holes in walls.
- Fixed melee weapons not working inside ruins due to the colliders that block subs from entering the ruins.
- Fixed small "twitch" when a character enters or exits a submarine.
- Fixed server lobby screen not scaling correctly after changing to a bigger resolution.
- Made the screen distortion effects caused by afflictions change less abruptly when the condition of the character changes quickly.
- Fixed items being swapped from slot to another when combining an item with one that has a higher condition.
- Fixed lights in deviced bleeding through characters and blurry black "shadow" around characters.
- Fixed '+' and '-' signs in number input fields being misaligned in Chinese and Japanese.
- Fixed Workshop item descriptions only showing the first 256 characters.
- Fixed reactor highlight effect extending outside the reactor sprite.
- Fixed ID-restricted doors only taking the first ID card in the inventory into account.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.6.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Networking/multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed the game occasionally freezing when joining a server.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused clients to disconnect with an "entity not found" error in the multiplayer. In technical terms, the issue occurred when the server spawned an entity with a given ID, sent a network event for that entity, and then spawned another entity that took up the ID of the previous entity. This could happen, for example, if in the multiplayer campaign a player happens to get an item with the same ID as an item in the inventory of another player who isn't currently present, and the other player joins the server. There are still most likely additional bugs that can cause similar error messages, so this fix will probably not get rid of the errors entirely.
- Fixed start button staying disabled in the server lobby when switching from the campaign mode to another game mode.
- Fixed clients occasionally getting disconnected due to the campaign store. Happened if a location had changed from one type to another (for example, natural formation to outpost), the players had bought something that wasn't originally available from the location and a new client joined.
- Fixed clients occasionally being prompted to download subs from the server even if they already have a matching sub.
- Fixed server having a password even if the password box is left empty in the in-game "host server" menu when hosting with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name being shortened to one word when hosting from the in-game "host server" menu with the Linux version.
- Fixed server name length not being restricted when set from serversettings.xml or using console commands.
- Fixed "ready to start" tickbox disappearing if a client joins while a round is running.
- Fixed traitors remaining as traitors client-side after restarting the round, allowing them to access the sabotage interface despite not having a traitor objective.
- Fixed characters occasionally not selecting/deselecting a periscope client-side, causing them to walk in place or not grab the periscope.
- Fixed male asian heads not appearing in the server lobby.
- Fixed campaign servers never being filtered out from the server browser when filtering based on game mode.
- Fixed clients not displaying the "could not connect" popup if the initial connection to a server times out.
- Fixed door weld state occasionally getting desynced, causing the door to be welded server-side but possible to open client-side.

Electricity fixes:
- Fixed junction boxes not passing signals to relays.
- Fixed broken junction boxes and relays carrying power.
- Fixed devices not receiving power if they're connected directly to batteries/supercapacitors with no relays or junction boxes in between.
- Fixed light components that receive power from somewhere else than a power input connection not going out when they lose power (e.g. lights on the diving suits).
- Fixed pumps and batteries operating/recharging faster when receiving overvoltage, with no upper limit, making it possible to for example operate pumps at 10x the speed by connecting them to a relay that's receiving 10x more power than is being drawn from it.
- Fixed LightComponents being toggled twice when they receive a signal to the toggle connection.

Misc fixes:
- Fixed "last used" listbox overlapping with the entity visibility tickboxes in the submarine editor on low resolutions. 
- Fixed misaligned colliders on the "Shell A Cap 0 deg A/B" wall pieces.
- Fixed links disappearing between linked subs and docking ports when loading in the sub editor.
- Fixed loading freezing for up to 10 seconds if the game cannot fetch the remote content for the main menu (update notifications, changelogs, etc).
- Fixed lights on devices (junction boxes, nav terminals, reactor) being rendered on top of characters.
- Fixed lights lagging a little behind moving objects (e.g. diving suit light).
- Fixed characters being able to grab/heal others when handcuffed.
- Character editor: don't switch to the limb mode when clicking a limb in the joint edit mode. Fixes difficulties in using the joint angle widgets when the widgets are interloping limb source rects.
- Character editor: Fixed the texture path field not being copied if the source character has no texture path defined. In this case, we can use a texture path found in one of the limbs.
- Fixed bots incorrectly reporting problems in the room they are in instead of the room the issues is spotted at.
- Fixed bots reporting broken devices or asking medical attendance even if they are taking care of those things.
- Fixed bots saying "put out a fire in hull" instead of using the name of the room when they extinguish a fire.
- Fixed AITargets staing active even if the entity is not active (for example, the sonar could still be heard by monsters after it's turned off).
- The bots now only report about issues that have not been already been reported.
- Fixed monsters attacking doors that are open.
- Monsters keep pursuing the target if the behavior is "pursue" even when they cannot attack.
- Bots stop operating devices if a player starts operating them (unless they have been ordered to operate the device).
- Fixed bots playing the rewiring sound when repairing an item with a screwdriver.
- Fixed bots sometimes stopping behind a closed door when trying to extinguish a fire.
- Fixed chat messages occasionally extending below the lower bound of the chatbox.
- Fixed searchlight and turret lights disappearing before the light is fully off-screen.
- Waypoint fixes in Kastrull and the drone.
- Fixed Kastrull flooding when the drone is undocked.
- Fixed ballast pumps in Kastrull's drone being off by default.
- Fixed enormous in-game ballistic helmet sprite.
- Fire extinguishers can't be placed inside toolboxes anymore.
- Fixed lobby screen not scaling correctly after changing to a bigger resolution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing when attempting to start a tutorial.
- Fixed Kastrull's drone not being docked to the sub by default.
- Fixed items occasionally launching through walls/floors when they're spawned or dropped.
- Nerfed Hammerhead Spawns.
- Fixed occasional disconnections when the Hammerhead Matriarch releases her spawns.
- Fixed Hammerhead Matriarch exploding twice when it attacks.
- Fixed bots sometimes getting stuck in an objective loop, causing them to repeatedly drop and pick up diving suits or spam doors.
- Fixed bots being allowed to go outside without a diving suit.
- Fixed characters with a rectangular main collider being unable to use path finding.
- Fixed microphone volume scrollbar resetting to the maximum value when opening the settings menu.
- Fixed a bug that caused occasional crashes on Linux when pinging servers in the server list menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Misc additions and changes:
- A new submarine, Kastrull.
- 6 new traitor missions with much more varied objectives.
- More variants of all job outfits.
- 30 new character face sprites. 
- Overhauled job assignment logic to make the job distribution a little more balanced. Now each client gets assigned one of the spawnpoints (and its associated job) according to their job preference, which means that if the sub for example has 2x as many engineer spawnpoints than medic spawnpoints, there tend to be 2x more engineers. When playing with a mod that adds new jobs to the game, spawnpoints that have no job associated with them are considered spawnpoints for the non-vanilla jobs.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: does the job assignment seem fair, are people generally getting the jobs they want? 
- New logic components: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, modulo, round, ceil, floor and factorial.
- Improved autopilot: much faster and less likely to get stuck.
	- We would like to get feedback from players about this: Is there still incentive to steer manually?
- AI characters don't set stationary batteries to recharge unless ordered to do so.
- Items can be made damageable by projectiles, melee weapons and explosions by adding DamagedByProjectiles="true", DamagedByMeleeWeapons="true" or DamagedByExplosions="true" to the config.
- Nerfed welding fuel + diving mask combo. The tank depletes much faster and one tank is only enough to make the target fall unconscious, not to kill them.
- Added deconstruction recipes to all drugs.
- Added huskified face sprites to all characters.
- Question prompts in the debug console and dedicated server console (such as "enter the reason to ban XXX") can be cancelled by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z (or Ctrl+C in the in-game debug console).
- Welding tools and plasma cutters explode when loaded with the wrong fuel.
- Removed sodium as a product of recycling fire extinguishers.
- Added some loose vents and panels to Orca and Typhon.
- Option to set a name for a character added by a mod without having to configure it in a separate text file. Use displayname="somemonster" in the character element to set the name.
- Balanced splash screen audio volumes.
- Alarm buzzers twitch when active to make it more clear where the sound is coming from.
- Scrollbars that work as on/off switches (e.g. power switches and autotemp sliders in item interfaces) can be toggled by clicking on them.
- Decreased the chance of selecting a traitor mission that's already been selected during the session.

Multiplayer:
- Option to choose a "play style" for the servers to tell the players what kind of gameplay and rules they can expect on the server.
- Improved server browser:
	- More filtering options
		- Same version
		- Show whitelisted
		- Karma enabled
		- Traitors enabled
		- Friendly fire off
		- Voice chat enabled
		- Modded
	- Option to filter by play style.
	- Option to filter by game mode.
	- Added the option to favorite servers.
	- Added a list of recent servers.
	- Added a friends list, you can keep track on which servers your friends are playing at as well as join them directly from the friends list.
	- Miscellaneous layout improvements.
- Improved server lobby:
	- Improved character customization interface: players now have full control over their appearance.
	- Improved job preferences interface: players can now more easily switch around their class preferences, as well as pick which variation of an outfit they would like to wear.
	- Mission selection is more flexible: mission types can be toggled separately.
	- The campaign interface is displayed directly in the menu, not in a separate view.
	- The submarine preview is displayed directly in the menu without having to open a separate window.
	- The job preferences of other players are indicated in the player list.
	- Voice chat icon now indicates the loudness of the audio being transmitted/received.
	- Voice chat settings are indicated in the bottom-right corner of the chat box.
	- The server log is integrated into the chat box.
	- Added new server settings under anti-griefing tab which previously were only accessible through serversettings.xml.
		- Allow friendly fire.
		- Allow rewiring.
		- Allow disguises.
	- Miscellaneous layout changes.

Human AI:
- Changed the logic for automatically unequipping the diving gear, extinguishers or items that are held in hands.
- Taught the bots to place diving suits, fuel rods and fire extinguishers into right places, if they can't unequip the items without dropping them AND if the current objective is not high priority. The system uses tags/identifiers and two new attributes: "preferredcontainers" in Items and "containablerestrictions" in ItemComponents so it can be adjusted both in the editor and in xml.
- Improved the code to prevent dead-locks between the AI states.
- Start looking new oxygen when the current oxygen tank is at 10% instead of starting when it's empty (which often lead the bot to suffocate while doing the objective).
- Combat: Don't ignore empty weapons when evaluating weapons for the first time (allows to try reloading a weapon before ignoring it as useless).
- Fight Intruders: Automatically switch weapon when the current weapon runs out of ammo. Find ammunition for the current weapon if no other decent weapon is found. Don't allow to go offensive while armed with poor weapons, like a wrench.
- Fix Leaks: Improved the operating of welding tools.
- Rescue: Major refactoring. Allow to heal self. Improve the priority calculation. The priority is now based on the severity of wounds.
- Taught the bots to look deeper into the inventories (recursive) when seeking items.
- Changed the decision making on whether or not a bot needs diving gear.
- The bots now avoid unsafe paths in the idle state or when doing low priority objectives.
- The bots don't follow targets outside of the submarine.
- The bots don't stay still when idling underwater.They swim in place instead.
- Adjusted the combat priorities for the weapons.
- Increased the minimum initiatives.
- Adjusted the target evaluation for the Fix Leaks objective.
- Improved the distance approximations for all AI objectives.
- Increased the base devotion (how much the current objective priority is boosted).
- Reduced the shooting distance when the bots are operating turrets.
- Adjusted the idle waiting, standing, and walking times.
- Fixed bots getting stuck if the next node was behind a door.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when the main collider bottom was slightly lower than the floor level, even though the bot should be able to take off from the ladders.
- Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders when they need a new target while climbing.
- Fixed bots ignoring/avoiding targets in hulls when there were dead enemies inside them.
- Fixed issues in switching empty oxygen tanks to new.
- Fixed bots unequipping and re-equipping diving gear while ordered to follow another character.
- Fixed bots not being able to handle things when they cannot find diving gear. Now they should first try to get the gear and if it fails, they should just target a safe hull.
- Fixed bots shooting friendly characters with turrets.
- Fixed bots always treating weapons as revolvers.
- Fixed the loading of smg magazines/fuel tanks etc (because they are different from revolver rounds).
- Fixed autonomic objectives overriding the user-defined settings (steering, batteries).
- Fixed bots being able to do things while hand-cuffed.
- Fixed a dead-end when an item is taken by another character after the target item was defined and before the objective is completed.
- Fixed item prioritization calculations.
- Fixed hull safety calculations always using the current visible hulls (which should only be taken into account when the hull is the current hull).
- Fixed bots abandoning the operate item objective if there was another character operating the item.
- Fixed bots speaking about success/failure to repair when another character fixes their target.
- Fixed bots reporting individual failures when doing a loop objective. Should fix bots spamming with the "Cannot reach the target" msgs.
- Fixed the current objective not being reassigned after sorting the objectives, leading to sorting the subobjectives of the old current objective, which would be fixed only after the next time the objectives were sorted (after 1 sec).
- Fixed the gap size being misinterpreted when calculating the priority for a fix leak objective.
- Fixed bots switching repair targets while repairing an item.
- Fixed bots in some situations facing the wrong direction. The bots should now always face the item they are operating.
- Fixed bots' ragdolls getting unstable due to constant flipping in some rare cases.
- Fixed bots not immediately targeting the other rooms when they reach the airlock (when entering the submarine).

Monsters:
- New monster: Hammerhead Matriarch
- New monster: Hammerhead Spawn
- New diving suit sprite for husks.
- Characters now have a separate property that defines whether or not they can walk, meaning that characters can now enter the submarine even if they cannot walk. When there is no water, the character will fidget around.
Also fixes Fractal Guardians flying in non-flooded alien ruins.
- Monsters now remember the position of the last target even when idling. The memories fade, however.
- Monsters now flee briefly when being fired at with the turrets. Fixes swarming characters being easy to exploit.
- Don't allow the monsters to retaliate unless they are in the same submarine as the attacker. Removed the CanRetaliate parameter on character AI that was added in the previous update.
- Refactored ConditionalSprite: ConditionalSprite now takes Sprite or DeformableSprite as child elements.
- StatusEffects can now be used to spawn characters.
- Monster missions now support multiple monsters of different species.
- Minor adjustments on eating. Fixes Bonethresher's eating animation.
- Improved the avoid steering logic (used when the character is not using pathfiding, i.e. outside the submarine).
- Charybdis: Increase the damage against structures for all attacks.
- Adjusted Mudraptor, Bonethresher and Tigerthersher behavior. Threshers now hunt in packs.
- Fixed incorrect flipping and mirroring. Disable mirroring on characters that don't need it.
- Fixed Mudraptors preferring doors over humans.
- Fixed targeting at wall center position instead of the section position. Fixes hammerheads and bonethreshers targeting destroyed wall sections.
- Fixed the damage modifiers on hammerheads not working properly.
- Fixed a crash when trying to create a swarm with characters that have no swarming behavior defined.
- Fixed monsters not targeting the closest limb when they should.
- Fixed ai targets not being updated when the character is dead, causing the characters to be too perceivable/not perceivable enough by the monsters.
- Fixed limbs' lightsources not being visible inside the submarine.
- Fixed immobilized characters (e.g. stunned, monsters on dry land) occasionally "hanging" mid-air.
- Fixed draw order issues due to normal sprites and deformable sprites being used on the same characters.

Character editor:
- Added "TailTorqueBoost" parameter that can be used to prevent long and fast-moving characters, like the Tigerthresher, to get tangled around themselves.
- "TailTorque" no longer affects the swimming sine amplitude (how strong the tail moves).
- Sprite orientation no longer affects the damage modifiers.
- Exposed the ragdoll main limb.
- Exposed the damage emitters.
- Exposed the damage sound of damage modifiers.
- The radial widget angles are now rounded to the closest 10.
- Fixed characters being able to collide with the submarine, which often caused large monsters to get stunned and impact sounds to be played when they're spawned.
- Fixed characters moving when they shouldn't.

Bugfixes:
- Rewrote power distribution logic to resolve several issues and oddities in the way power was distributed across electrical grids, particularly when relays were used. The new system is also less performance intensive, so submarines that had performance issues due to large and complex power grids should now run better.
- Fixed inability for mods to override jobs.
- Fixed pumps calculating targetlevel incorrectly when receiving a "set_targetlevel" signal, causing neutral ballast level value in the sub editor to be off.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers when they're using content packages the server doesn't have, which usually causes the client to get disconnected when a round starts.
- Fixed clients being able to join servers after enabling a required content package in the settings, even though they need to restart first (leading to errors when a round starts).
- Fixed "attempted to access a potentially removed character" console errors if a character dies while the client is waiting to apply the character's remote inventory state.
- Fixed broken waypoints in Typhon that prevented bots from opening some of the doors.
- Fixed characters being very hard or impossible to hit with melee weapons when they're lying on the floor.
- Fixed characters placing their feet above a platform when not actually standing on the platform (noticeable in rooms where there's a platform on top of the "actual" floor).
- Fixed husk eggs not causing a husk infection when injected.
- Fixed depth sorting not working on damageable structures.
- Fixed characters stepping on nothing if their feet are below the lowest step of a ladder.
- Fixed door components being selectable when the door is broken, causing characters to drop from ladders if they interact with a door while climbing.
- Alien motion sensors don't react to dead bodies to prevent bodies from blocking the way through the ruins by constantly activating coils.
- Fixes to waypoints and outdated structure sourcerects in Bunyip, Selkie & Venture.
- Put the shotgun shells in Dugong's, Kastrull's and Humpback's armory inside the shotgun.
- Fixed clients retaining their original character when taking control of another one in the multiplayer campaign, but keeping the items of the new character.
- Fixed sourcerects being moved when going through the sprite lists with arrow keys in the sprite editor.
- Fixed servers occasionally appearing in the server list twice.
- Improved color input layout in EntityEditors to prevent overlaps.
- Fixed flares not depleting when in inventory.
- Fixed propeller position becoming unmirrored when saving and reloading a mirrored engine.
- Fixed detection area offset becoming unmirrored when saving and reloading a mirrored motion sensor.
- Fixed a couple of doors and hatches in vanilla subs being repairable with welding tools instead of wrenches.

- Fixed door gaps occasionally getting misplaced when placing them in ruins, preventing water from flowing through the room.
- Fixed "picked/selected required" fields disappearing from the item editing panel in the submarine editor if left blank.
- Fixed being able to hit through walls with melee weapons.
- Fixed framerate issues when using passive sonar near large amounts of sound emitters (right outside a submarine for example).
- Fixed empty exploding ammo boxes exploding when deconstructed.
- Fixed old chat messages overlapping in the server lobby after the scrollbar of the chatbox becomes active.
- Fixed textbox selection not being cleared when pressing Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+R, causing a crash if the selection is outside the bounds of the current text and the player attempts to remove text from the box.
- Don't allow reporting things while inside ruins.
- Fixed crashing if a client has written something in the chatbox, gets disconnected and sends the message.
- Fixed servers showing up in the server lobby after the server has been shut down.
- Fixed traitor missions not ending when the traitor dies and the traitor retaining their old mission info in the info menu.
- Fixed dead characters still appearing in the crew list when a client joins mid-round.
- Fixes to decorative sprites: Rotation property is in degrees, fixed offset anim type being used as the rotation anim.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.4.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monster additions and changes:
- New character: Bonethresher.
- New character: Golden Hammerhead.
- Completely remade the Tigerthresher (new skin, ragdoll, behavior and attacks).
- Reworked Hammerhead (new ragdoll, adjusted behavior and attacks).
- Adjusted the behavior of most characters.
- Medium sized monsters can now more easily trigger impact effects when ramming the submarine.
- Characters are now allowed to move faster than previously (9 -> 15).
- Changed the mouth position calculations and redefined the values for all monsters that have the eating behavior.
- Removed Moloch Baby (Which was just a test. Molochs will be revisited later).
- Better bend deformations on limbs.
- Better feedback about hit impacts on limbs when the character takes damage.
- AI monsters should hit moving targets more easily.
- Added configurable health regeneration, which is applied when the character is eating a corpse.
- Added configurable affliction reductions (bleeding, burn, damage).
- Added an option for the monsters to ignore retaliation when they are attacked.
- Added an option to target the attack on specific limb types.
- Added an option to continue the movement, "following through" the target after the attack.

Modding improvements:
- Mods can override specific content without having to create a completely new content package. This can
be done by surrounding the element with "<override></override>" (for example, an Item or a Character
config element you want to replace a vanilla Item/Character with). The overrides work based on identifiers;
for instance, if you configure an item with the identifier "wrench" and surround it with the override
tags, it will replace the vanilla wrench.
- Content package load order: the game will first load the core package, then other content in the order
 of selection (proper ui still pending). The load order is saved in the config_player.xml.
- Made AI orders and event manager settings moddable.
- The engine and reactor sound ranges can now be modified in the item XML.
- The husk affliction can now be modified and applied on any character.
- Support for multiple simultaneous husk afflictions based on the same system.
- Support for multiple husk appendages. Made the attachment limb configurable in the affliction definition.
- Additional content package validity checks during startup: make sure all XML files in the package can 
be loaded, and disable the package if they can't. Fixes tons of console errors on startup when a mod with 
invalid XML files is enabled.
- Don't allow publishing workshop items that contain invalid XML files.
- Don't allow selecting invalid content packages in the settings menu.
- Fixed disabled content packages becoming active when they're autoupdated.

- Support for limb sounds.
- Support for light sources attached to limbs.
- Support for adding and removing attacks.
- Support for afflictions in attacks.
- Support for damage modifiers in limbs.
- New functionality: creating limbs (without having to operate on duplicates).
- Support for creating humanoids.
- Allow to create new characters based on an existing character (copy character).
- Added a limb specific "sprite orientation" that overrides the universal "spritesheet orientation".
- Option for mirroring limb sprites.
- Option for hiding the limb sprite (invisible limbs).
- Multiple minor additions and changes, like an option to enable lights or to display the damage modifiers
drawn on the character.
- Exposed structure sound types.
- Exposed the mouth position.
- Exposed the angular damping and density for limbs (removed mass, which was not used).
- Added a default texture path for ragdolls so that the texture can only be defined once. Limb specific 
texture definitions override this.
- Allow to define a group for different species. The characters in the same group are friendly to each other.
- DecorativeSprites can now be used on character limbs (like on items).
- Made it easier to adjust the source rect's position with the arrows. Hold CTRL to change the size.
- Fixed a rare case where characters got stunned in the character editor.

Misc improvements:
- New husk faces.
- Increased default VOIP and microphone volume and the maximum values.
- Force a restart when switching the language.
- More detailed "x is not a valid XML file" error messages.
- Improved mission and traitor info popups.
- Show the number of lights (total and shadow-casting) in the sub editor.
- When rewiring, clicking the right mouse button only removes one node from the wire.
- Wire nodes are added by left clicking in the sub editor, and can be laid out horizontally/vertically
by holding shift.
- Improved logging for DXGI_ERROR crashes on startup.
- Made level ambient lighting darker.
- Added "pause" console command (only usable in single player).

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing when the recharge speed of a PowerContainer with no interface (e.g. Alien Generator) is 
adjusted by a signal or a bot.
- Fixed docking interface becoming active on navigation terminals when any of the submarine's docking
ports are close to another docking port, even if the terminal in question is not wired to that port.

- Fixed clients not creating a download prompt when a sub they don't have is selected by vote.
- Fixed traitor missions almost always placing the mission-related items inside the same containers.
- Fixed traitor goal durations being displayed as "duration(xx) seconds" instead of "xx seconds".
- Fixed Traitor's "find an item" objectives not being considered complete if the target item is inside 
another item within the traitor's inventory.
- Fixed server using the provided campaign savefile name as-is (without the required .save file extension) 
when starting a new campaign through the console. Caused clients to throw "File transfer failed (wrong 
file extension """!)" errors and prevented them from receiving the save files.
- Fixed servers being able to start the round multiple times by spamming the "start" console command 
before loading the round finishes.
- Fixed rewiring sound playing whenever a remote player is using a rewireable device.
- Fixed subinventories not opening when grabbing another character with no items in the corresponding slot.
- Fixed draggable inventories getting stuck to a half-open state if the item is equipped when 
the inventory is opening/closing.

- Fixed item sprites becoming unmirrored when a damaged sprite is fading in.
- Fixed damaged item sprites that are set to fade in according to the damage always being drawn at full opacity.
- Fixed spectators being distributed into teams in combat missions, potentially leading to imbalanced crew sizes.
- Notify the client using the "togglekarmatestmode" command about the test mode being enabled/disabled.
- Send karma change notifications when karma has changed by 1 unit or more when test mode is enabled, not 
just when an action causes an immediate change of 1 unit or more.
- Fixed adjacent sprites bleeding into the platform and topwindow sprites.
- Fixed autocompleting submarine/shuttle names when using the submarine/shuttle console commands.
- Fixed some items (like sonar beacon) attracting monsters even when they're powered off.
- Fixed inability to open the pause menu if an inventory slot had been highlighted when exiting 
the game screen.
- Fixed welded door sprites "twitching" when the submarine moves.
- Fixed crashing when a character with no hands or arms drops a holdable item.
- Non-humanoids (i.e. monsters controlled by a player) cannot be assigned as traitors.
- Traitor missions are considered unsuccessful if the objectives cannot be completed (for example if the
submarine doesn't have suitable containers to place the traitor items inside).
- Fixed the "Barotrauma" title text staying invisible in the main menu when coming back from the credits.
- Fixed clients not refreshing an item's editing hud when a remote player adjusts the values (i.e. if two 
players had selected the same lamp and one changed the color value, the other client wouldn't see 
the value change in the editing hud).
- Fixed a couple of the additive light sprites being slightly offset from the lamp.
- Clients don't display client-side vitality changes in healthbars until the actual vitality is received 
from the server. Fixes health occasionally dropping and then jumping back up if the client predicts damage 
incorrectly (e.g. if a melee attack hits client-side but doesn't server-side).
- Fixed character syncing being very inaccurate when switching to freecam and spectating a character
far away from other players.
- Fixed oxygen/fuel tanks attached to a tool being rendered behind the character's legs.

- Improvements to Russian and Spanish translations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.3.1

- Fixed clients with campaign management permissions not seeing the permissions of newly joined clients.
- Fixed statuseffects with a duration not having an effect on karma.
- Causing an "oxygen low" affliction decreases karma (for example when injecting large amounts of fentanyl).
- Fixed scroll values resetting in the multiplayer campaign store menu when purchasing/selling items.

Miscellaneous improvements:
- Attempting to drop an item to an empty inventory slot that's not of the right type (e.g. trying to put 
an extinguisher in the normal inventory slots), automatically moves the item to the correct slot if it's free.

- Stun guns and darts can be fabricated and purchased.
- More reliable melee weapon hit detection (for example in the security tutorial it was previously very
difficult to hit the crawler after it falls to the ground).

- Added confirmation popups when exiting the sub editor or character editor to prevent losing unsaved work.
- Fixed reactor warning lights being clickable and becoming invisible when pressed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Karma improvements:
- Attacking someone who has just recently attacked you doesn't reduce karma.
- The karma penalty from attacking someone scales according to their karma (i.e. smaller penalty for 
attacking a griefer whose karma is low).
- Damaging characters by performing CPR doesn't decrease karma.
- Fixed karma decreasing when moving a wire from a connection to another.
- Reviving characters with CPR increases karma.
- Made the default karma settings a little less strict.

- Less restrictive client name symbol constraints. Fixes clients failing to join servers if their name 
contains Chinese symbols for example.
- Fixed inability to enable/update content packages created for a version prior to 0.9.2.0 (ones that have 
the content package in the Data/ContentPackages folder instead of in the mod folder).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed crashing if a traitor client switches to a non-human creature and their original character dies.
- Traitors don't lose karma by damaging structures if their goal is to flood the sub.

- Fixed "error loading submarine" console error when creating a copy of a submarine, deleting the original 
sub and then saving the copy.
- Fixed server logging an "attempted to send a chat message to a null client" error when a client tries 
to send a private message to a non-existent client.
- Enable dynamic range compression and VOIP attenuation by default.
- Fixed inability to extinguish fires through holes in walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.2.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easier server hosting:
- Switched to Steam's networking API, which allows clients to connect to servers without the need for the
host to forward their ports.

Expanded traitor feature:
- Multi-step traitor missions that not only make things more interesting to the traitors themselves but 
also to give the rest of the crew a fighting chance of detecting the traitor.

Anti-griefing:
- Karma: a system that detects malicious actions and automatically creates a more challenging experience 
for griefers, or potentially triggers a kickban. The feature is completely optional and the server hosts 
can decide how aggressively it will react to malicious actions. In a nutshell, you can lose karma for doing 
dumb things, karma is regained gradually over time and may be increased more rapidly by doing good things, 
thus negating false positives and also giving you the chance to redeem yourself. Lose too much karma and 
you'll start to experience increasing levels of inconvenience.
- Wire griefing is more difficult: wires have to be disconnected from the connection panels at both ends
before they can be removed. Disconnected wires can be seen visibly hanging from the device, with noticeable
particle effects and sound cues that make it easier to detect and fix wiring problems.
- Added a built-in overheat warning light and siren to reactors and increased the time it takes for the
reactor to catch fire and explode.
- Option to disable friendly fire altogether.

New items and structures:
- Additional weapons: stun gun, SMG, shotgun, grenade launcher, flamer, two new types of coilgun ammunition (piercing & explosive).
- New monster loot: husk stinger, mudraptor shell, crawler mask, moloch shell.
- Fun stuff: accordion, captain's pipe, toy hammer.
- Tons of new decorative submarine pieces for the sub editor.

New submarine:
- Berilia, a submarine for 16 players.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing when selecting doors or gaps in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when combining items inside an ItemContainer (e.g. cabinet, deconstructor).
- Fixed shuttles not being able to redock into some submarines with unconventionally positioned docking 
ports. Specifically, if a port needed to be docked to from below but was positioned above the center of
the submarine (or vice versa), the docking interface would not activate on the navigation terminal.
- Fixed docking port using the wrong submarine's position for joint adjustment, causing errors when 
docking a submarine with greater mass to one with a smaller mass.
- Fixed an issue that caused occasional ID mismatch errors if a client died during a multiplayer
campaign round and disconnected before the round ended.
- Fixed item editing panel not appearing in wiring mode when selecting a wire in the sub editor.
- Fixed ability to throw throwable items while unconscious.
- Fixed bots not using fire extinguishers client-side in multiplayer.
- Fixed clients not hearing the sound when someone crowbars a door open.
- Fixed progress bars not showing client-side when cutting/welding doors.

scale in the submarine editor.
- Fixed inability to scroll the crew list with the mouse wheel when the cursor is over certain parts 
of the list.
- Fixed sonar pings stopping mid-way when active sonar is turned off, which could be exploited to stop
the pings before they reach a monster further away from the sub.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters when entering spectator mode after their character has been
eaten by a creature.
- Fixed clients not seeing other characters in spectator mode after the distance between the submarine 
and the client's corpse gets great enough.
- Fixed clients getting stuck to a non-functional game screen if they start a new round before the ending 
cinematic has finished server-side.
- Fixed projectiles hitting a character you're standing next to when firing.
- Fixed characters automatically equipping handcuffs (i.e. handcuffing themselves) if they were picked up
when the only free inventory space was the hand slots.
- Fixed a rare race condition that occasionally caused the game to crash during the loading screen with 
a "no text packs available in English!" error message.
- Fixed husk infection being healable with broad-spectrum antibiotics even when the infection has reached 
the final stage.
- Fixed attachable items (detonators, electrical components) becoming deattachable without any tools 
if the sub is saved after deattaching them.
- Fixed projectile raycasts not taking wall rotation into account, causing the projectiles to hit sloped 
walls when standing next to them.
- Fixed PowerTransfer components checking overloads based on the item the recursive power check starts from, 
not the item that's currently being checked. Caused junction boxes to never break or catch fire in some subs
- Fixed crashing in the character editor when no textures were found for the selected character.
- Fixed crashing if a humanoid character has no knees or ankles.
- Fixed EventManager calculating flooding amount incorrectly, causing floods to only have a very small
effect on the intensity value.
- Fixed batteries and supercapacitors being able to provide power through their signal connections 
(e.g. "set_charge_rate", "charge_rate_out").
- Lighting fix: obstruct background lights behind hulls. Previously the background lights would only get 
obstructed by background structures, causing light to "bleed through" parts with no structures (e.g. 
humpback's docking port) and windows in the background walls.
- Fixed item loading being interrupted if any item XML cannot be loaded, causing some items not to be
loaded if any of the selected content packages are missing files or contain corrupted item XMLs.
- Fixed fire sounds not playing when standing inside a fire source.
- Fixed client names being converted to lower case when comparing them to the name written by the sender, 
preventing the message from being sent if the name wasn't written in lower case.
- Pass private messages to the client hosting the server when the message is targeted to the server.
- Private messages appear in the server log.
- Fixed plasma cutter and welding tool hit particles being offset from the flame.
- Fixed steel bar and titanium-aluminium alloy deconstructing to 100% condition items even when degraded 
(which could be used as an exploit to get infinite coilgun rounds).
- Fixed holdable items staying in the characters hand(s) when swapping them from a hand slot to another 
limb slot (for example, when moving a flashlight from a hand slot to the head slot).
- Fixed text wrapping not working properly with words that are longer than a single line.
- Fixed deconstructor losing some of the material from deconstructed items if the output container couldn't hold all of the new items.
- Fixed discrepancies in door welding & repairing logic regarding collision.
- Fixed a crash when retrieving lobby information with an uninitialized IP.
- Fixed max player count in server list & duplicate lobby entries.
- Fixed arrow keys not changing caret position when typing.
- Fixed doors looking repaired as soon as the condition goes above 0%, even though the collisions aren't 
re-enabled until the door gets above 50%.
- Fixed water not leaking through broken doors.
- Fixed inability to throw items through platforms.

Misc additions and changes:
- Respawn shuttles now spawn inside the level somewhere near the submarine, instead of always spawning
at the beginning of the level.
- Respawn shuttles don't leave and despawn until a new respawn is pending.
- Added "respawnnow" console command which immediately dispatches the respawn shuttle.
- Search for default animation/ragdoll folders from the folder where the character file is located, not
from "Content/Characters". Fixes mods not being able to load animation/ragdoll files if the file paths
are not defined explicitly in the character configuration file.
- Improved performance by deleting dead monsters that are far away from the sub and by disabling physics
on dead bodies when they stay still long enough.
- Added option to use conditionals to activate/deactivate ItemComponents. You can take a look at the 
reactor and junction box config files to see how it's used.
- Added some indicator lights to junction boxes and reactors.
- Stun batons don't affect large enemies (molochs, hammerheads, endworms, etc).
- In wiring mode, items are selected by pressing E instead of clicking. Selecting items with the left
mouse button made it very difficult to manipulate the wires because it was easy to accidentally select
some device instead of a wire node. 
- Crate/toolbox inventories stay open and can be moved across the screen when the item is equipped.
- Added limits to submarine name and description length.
- Delete incomplete file downloads when disconnecting from a server while a file transfer is active.
Prevents console errors about corrupted submarine/save files caused by the partially downloaded files.
- Increased Humpback's battery capacity.
- Added widgets for manipulating coilgun/railgun rotation limits in the sub editor.
- Added a command for setting the value of a property on all selected entities in the sub editor 
(for example, "setentityproperties scale 2" would set the scale of all selected items/structures to 2).
- Show ballast tanks and airlocks in a different color on the status monitor to make it easier to 
distinguish which rooms are actually flooding and which are supposed to have water in them.
- Option to define multiple inventory variants for a character (e.g. to add variation to monster loot).
- Start playing the main menu music during the loading screen.
- More reliable human walk sounds (played at specific points of the walk cycle instead of relying on 
impacts between the feet and the floor).
- Option to show a 16x16 grid and snap the cursor to it in the sprite editor.
- Reactor can be controlled with movement keys.
- Option to add a probability for afflictions applied by an attack.
- Husk attacks have a 50% chance of causing a husk infection.
- Decreased minimum item scale from 0.1 to 0.01.
- The amount of materials received from deconstructing fuel rods depends on the condition of the fuel rod.
- Reactors keep sending the temperature_out signal after a meltdown.
- Improved file transfer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- Disabled riot shields for now (too much griefing potential).
- Toolboxes can be fabricated and decontructed.
- Nerfed nitroglycerin's structure damage and increased the impact tolerance from 4 to 6.
- Made alien pistols a little less underwhelming (sounds, recoil, particle effects).
- Deconstructors drop all items that are inside the deconstructed item. Previously they would just get destroyed, 
making it a potential exploit to destroy items that should not be possible to deconstruct.
- Modified welding fuel tank and oxygen tank sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Modified plasma cutter and welding tool sprites a bit to differentiate them from each other a bit more.
- Diving suits play the warning beep when there's no tank in the suit (not just when the tank is running out).
- Server list can be sorted according to ping, name, compatibility or any of the other property in the list.
- Docking ports of the enemy submarine are not shown on the sonar during combat missions.
- Recharge headset batteries between rounds in single player.
- Disable status monitor displays when out of power.

- The game automatically opens the generated crash report when it crashes.
- Added "setmaxplayers" command to the dedicated server.
- Clients can change the server password using the command "setpassword" if they have a permission from the host.
- Reduced the range of the sonar ping sound and added a more subtle ping sound that can be heard further away.
- Watchmen now hold position when attacked.
- Added a subtle glow to alien buttons to make them a bit more noticeable.
- Items that are set to be hidden in-game can still be interacted with in the sub editor.
- EXPERIMENTAL: option to disable rewiring items in multiplayer. At the moment the setting can only be
changed by editing a parameter called "allowrewiring" in serversettings.xml.

Misc bugfixes:
- Fixed the position of an outpost's docking port not being taken into account when determining how to 
place it in the level. Caused large submarines sometimes to collide with walls when docked to outposts 
where the port is offset from the center.
- Fixed corrupted sub files causing crashes.
- Fixed item editing HUD not appearing on any other item after one item has been selected in-game 
(e.g. editing the channel on a wifi component prevented editing other items).
- Fixed ladders and other resizeable items reverting to their original size if they're resized and 
the sub is saved and reloaded.
- Fixed inability to resize gaps in the sub editor after they've been placed.
- Reactors take other power sources into account when calculating how much power they need to generate. 
Fixes overloads on Humpback when turning on the backup batteries and operating the reactor normally.
- Fixed watchmen not retaliating when a character does very small amounts of damage to them.
- Fixed bots being able to take handcuffs off from themselves.
- Fixed waypoint and spawnpoints being selectable in the sub editor even if they're hidden.
- Fixed deconstructing coilgun ammo boxes giving out more materials than the materials required to fabricate them.
- Scrollbars can only be dragged if the mouse button is pressed down while the cursor is on the scrollbar,
not by holding the button and moving it on the scrollbar. Fixes accidentally switching from slider 
to another (often happens in the reactor interface).
- Fixed crashing when setting limb or joint scale to 0 using console commands.
- Fixed dropdowns in the Workshop item publish menu being draw behind the buttons below them.
- Fixes bots being unable to exit ladders if some part of their body is below the platform.
- Ignore keyboard inputs (delete, arrow keys, copy/paste) in the sub editor when a textbox is selected.
Prevents accidentally deleting items/structures when attempting to delete text from a textbox.
- Toolboxes can't be put inside other toolboxes or in the doctor's clothes.
- Fixed items bought from the store during a singleplayer campaign session being deducted from the credits 
when save & quitting from the map.
- Flares stop emitting particles when inside an inventory.
- Fixed oxygen not flowing through horizontal gaps between subs (e.g. between Remora and the drone).
- Decreased the size of the mountain in the RidgeBasic level type to prevent it from blocking the main path.
- Fixed too small collider sizes on a bunch of crafting materials.
- Fixed order options ("hold fire"/"fire at will" etc) being displayed in one button instead of
being split into separate buttons when playing the game in Chinese.
- Fixed "Text Self_CauseOfDeathDescription.Unknown not found" console error if a character gets killed
by being inside a respawn shuttle when it despawns.
- Fixed sonar not scaling properly when resolution is changed mid-round.
- Fixed fabricators & deconstructors displaying the "insufficient power" warning when power is low 
(but still high enough for the devices to run).

Networking fixes:
- Fixed another ID mismatch problem that occasionally caused clients to get kicked out in multiplayer, 
usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed players always getting range banned when banned by a client.
- Fixed turrets not being aimed correctly in multiplayer if they're in another sub (e.g. the coilgun in 
Remora's drone).
- More reliable fabricator and deconstructor syncing. Should fix items disappearing when multiple players
attempt to use the device at the same time and strange timing inconsistencies when deconstructing
multiple items in succession.
- Fixed all servers showing "unknown" as the game mode in the server list. 
- Fixed server not allowing forward slashes in host messages.
- Fixed repair interface sometimes getting stuck close to 100% in multiplayer.

Character editor fixes and improvements:
- Nicer layout, made the panels hideable.
- Added buttons for creating joints, duplicating limbs, and deleting limbs/joints.
- A dropdown for selecting which content package to add the character to.
- Allow creating a new content package during character creation.
- Added hotkeys 1, 2, 3 for limb, joint, and animation modes respectively.
- Change the logic of deciding on which parameters are shown and when. In the ragdoll mode you can now 
see the ragdoll, but also scale it and see the main parameters. Source rects are now longer shown on the 
sprite sheet if limbs mode is disabled.
- Automatically select edit limbs mode when a new character is created.
- Option to create multiple limbs in the character creation wizard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.0.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Made husks more common.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed an ID mismatch problem that occasionally caused clients to get kicked out in the multiplayer 
campaign, usually with an error message warning about a missing item.
- Fixed servers using a local campaign save path sent by the client setupping the campaign, preventing
the campaign from starting up if the path does not exist at the server's end.
- Fixed radio communication occasionally not working between characters in the multiplayer campaign. Characters 
that had made it through at least one round were not able to communicate through radio with characters that 
have just been spawned for the first time.
- Kick votes persist during a multiplayer session even if the client disconnects (= disconnecting and rejoining 
just before you get kicked doesn't work anymore).
- The server sends a "this client previously used the name xxx" message when a client rejoins with a different name.
- Fixed GameServer.UnbanPlayer passing the name to BanList in lower case even though BanList was case 
sensitive (preventing unbanning clients with the "unban" command if their name is not in lower case).
- Fixed server not saving the whitelist when it's enabled/disabled, causing the setting to revert when 
relaunching the server.
- Fixed structure texture scale and texture offset now being reverting to default values when the 
submarine is saved by the server, causing them to reset between campaign rounds.
- Fixed client always launching the default "DedicatedServer.exe" even if using a content package that 
should replace the server exe.
- Servers only report content packages with files that cause multiplayer incompatibility to the master server. 
Fixes servers showing up as incompatible in the server list if they have custom sub files (or other types 
of files that don't cause compatibility issues) installed.

possible to change the resolution when in fullscreen without having to restart the game.
- Fixes to the DXGI crashes during startup.
- Fixed Character.GetConfigFile searching for the character file from all available content packages, not 
just the ones that are currently selected. Caused modded character files to affect the game even when 
the mod was not enabled, leading to various issues such as characters failing to equip items if the mod
changes the number or type of inventory slots a character has.

another item. For example, replacing a fuel rod in the reactor by dropping a new fuel rod on it caused
the reactor behave as if it had two rods in it.

Additions and changes:
- New control scheme: items are selected by left clicking, deselected with right click or esc, and held
items are used on devices by pressing E (e.g. when rewiring with a screwdriver or repairing something 
with a wrench). The new controls are somewhat experimental; the intention is to make them more intuitive
to new players. You can still switch back to the legacy control scheme from the game settings.
- Set default radio chat keybind to R and creature attack keybind to Mouse3.

at their end.
- More reliable item wall attaching syncing.

items). Fixes "received a position update for an item with no physics body" console errors when attaching
items to walls.
- Fixed spectate button staying visible when a round ends while a client is in the lobby.

has no active StatusEffects).
- Fixed severed limbs occasionally noclipping into the submarine.
- Fixed large engine emitting smoke before it becomes repairable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

next, option to rewatch the videos and re-read the instructions.
- Overhauled charybdis (still a work in progress though).
- Automatically grab adjacent ladders when the top/bottom of the current ladder is reached. Makes moving

a "ShowInHealthScannerThreshold" attribute to the affliction.
- Added labels next to periscopes in Humpback and Dugong.
- Modified Humpback's bilge to make it easier for AI characters to fix.
- Enemies can now navigate out from the sub when escaping.

- Made InventoryIconColor and ContainerColor properties saveable.
- Removed descriptive name from alien artifacts (so be extra careful when bringing them on board).
- Allow panning the campaign map with WASD.
- Allow editing selected wires in wiring mode (so it's possible to, for example, modify the colors of
the wires without having to disconnect them).
- Decreased structure damage done by frag grenades and made them disappear after they've exploded.
- Batteries output charge values as integers.
- Made damaged junction boxes less sensitive to overvoltage. Nearly broken junction boxes were barely able 
to handle any overvoltage, leading to chain reaction where one junction box breaking causes the grid to be 
overloaded, and the rest of the boxes start taking damage at an increasing speed.
- Reactors don't cool down when underwater anymore.
- Removed minimum conditions from battery deconstruction output (= deconstructing an empty battery still 
gives the materials used to craft the battery).
- Made a bunch of ItemContainer UI panels larger.
- Items can be dragged and dropped directly from the inventory into containers without having to select 
the container first.
- Plants can be picked up from the environment without any tools.
- Added more help texts to highlighted items ("[E] Interact", "[E] Climb"...)

Multiplayer fixes:
- Changes to event syncing logic to prevent cases where clients fall behind the server and get kicked out
due to the server not being able to send out network events to the clients fast enough.
- Networking optimizations that prevent level objects and continuously deteriorating items from creating
excessive amounts of network events.
- Fixed windows clients being unable to start a campaign in servers running on Linux.
- Fixed clients being unable to start a campaign using a submarine that's not in the default Submarine
folder at the server's side.
- Fixed loading submarine files and campaign saves occasionally failing when running multiple instances
of the game from the same install location (for example, a dedicated server executable and a client 
executable).
- Don't transfer files through the network when sending them to the owner of the server (i.e. a client 
hosting directly from the main executable).
- Fixed fires and water occasionally getting out of sync between a client using the fire/water console
commands and the server.
- Fixed clients disconnecting with an "unknown object header" error if they fail to read a network event
(when they should instead report the error to the server and wait for a message that contains a more
descriptive error).
- Campaign fix: clear missions from locations that change their type, and all adjacent locations. Not 
clearing them caused missions to still be available when they logically shouldn't be (e.g. a transport 
mission from an uninhabited location to another) and syncing issues in multiplayer.
- Disable campaign start button if a round is already running when joining.
- Fixed clients being unable to end campaign rounds at all if the sub isn't at the start/end outpost 
(regardless if they have the permission to end the round or not).
- Fixed campaign characters still being displayed in the server lobby after the game mode has been 
changed to something else.
- Fixed items in the characters inventory always starting at 100% condition client-side even if they had 
deteriorated during the previous round.
- Fixed LevelResource (mineral, plant, etc) deattach timers not being synced with clients.
- AI characters can take out excess fuel rods from the reactor when needed.
- Item interfaces and the health interface can be closed with Esc.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed almost all items using default repair duration values (10 seconds with high skills, 100 seconds
with low skills) instead of the ones configured in the item XMLs.
- Nuclear shells and nuclear depth charges disappear after they've exploded. 
- Fixed "trying to add a dead character to crewmanager" errors when attempting to revive a character 
killed by some other affliction than internal damage, bleeding or burns.
- Take the position of a sub's docking port into account when determining where to place outposts.
Previously the outposts were simply placed midway between the adjacent walls, which occasionally caused
problems with submarines whose docking port is close to the bow or tail.
- Fixed a bug in relay components that caused a bunch of issues in power grids that utilize relays:
Relays would receive the full amount of power from the grid regardless of the load of the devices
connected to the power_out connection, causing unnecessary overloads and fires.
- Fixed batteries being able to draw power through relay components that are connected directly to 
a power source, even if the relay isn't on.
- Don't allow steering the sub with WASD when a textbox is selected.
- Use the SpriteColor of the item when drawing the moving parts of turrets and doors.
- Fixed steering issues that caused monsters to swim in an incorrect direction when they're targeting
something inside the sub.
- Fixed a crash due when scaling the Mudraptor.
- Fixed crashing if a character has neither a head angle or a torso angle configured.
- Fixed characters always being created in the default folder in the character editor.
- Monsters don't target doors/hatches at the exterior of the sub when inside or inner doors when outside.
- Don't display disabled limbs on sonar (i.e. severed limbs that have "faded out").
- Close the save/load dialogs when leaving the sub editor. Otherwise they'll still be visible when 
re-entering the editor, and saving at that point will overwrite the previously loaded sub with an empty one.
- Removing an item after it's been combined doesn't trigger the OnBroken StatusEffects (e.g. combining two 
half-full flash powder jars doesn't cause them to explode).
- Fixed welding tools and plasma cutters not hitting targets if the barrel is inside the target (e.g. if
trying to weld a completely broken wall with the cutter partially inside the wall).
- Fixed very small mineral colliders that made them extremely hard to hit with the plasma cutter.
- Fixed items with no sprite crashing the game (now they just cause a console error).
- Don't allow autointeracting with contained items (e.g. picking up an ammunition box from a loader) 
if another item is currently selected. Makes it less likely for players to accidentally pick up items 
from containers when they deselect another item.
- Fixed characters not letting go of the character they're grabbing when the health interface is closed
by clicking outside the window.
- Fixed CrewManager throwing errors if changing resolutions when a crew member is dead.
- Fixed items emitting light from inside containers in the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- The fission rate gauge on the reactor now visualizes the amount of fuel available.
- Doors and hatches can now also be repaired with wrenches.
- Changed default StatusEffect conditional comparison type back to OR.
- Clients communicate syncing errors to the server, and the server logs a more descriptive error about
what went wrong. Should make it easier to diagnose disconnection issues from now on.
- Ending a multiplayer campaign round by talking to watchman doesn't require any special permissions.
- Server automatically ends rounds if there have been no players alive in 60 seconds and respawning 
is not allowed during the round.
- Added a button for resetting an entity's properties to the default values to the sub editor.
- Updated handheld sonar UI graphics.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed non-radio chat/VOIP having an unlimited distance.
- Fixed a networking bug that caused the server to send item state changes to the clients before sending
a message about the item being spawned. For example, spawning any item with a LightComponent would always
cause clients to get disconnected.
- Changes to the way the clients are put in sync with the server when joining mid-round. Should make it 
less likely for clients to get disconnected immediately after starting a round.
- StatusEffects only apply non-limb-specific afflictions to one limb even if targeting the whole character. 
Fixes drugs like fentanyl and morphine being way too harmful due to the oxygen loss affliction being 
applied once per every limb. 
- Fixed TargetItemComponentName not working in StatusEffect conditionals (making it impossible to create
conditionals that target a specific component of an item).
- Made all of the new medical items combinable and usable in a syringe gun (assuming the drug is in a syringe).
- Fixed inability to throw anything in the multiplayer.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign setup UI showing the client's subs instead of the server's.
- Fixed campaign view button overlapping with the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby.
- Fixed sub/mode voting not being enabled when changing the setting after the server has been started.
- Fixed character inventories occasionally being saved incorrectly in the multiplayer campaign when an
- Fixed flares not activating by left clicking.
- Fixed affliction icons flickering rapidly in the health interface and above the health bar if their
strength is fluctuating around the threshold where the icon becomes visible.
- Fixed dedicated server crashing when typing in more text than can fit on one line. 
- Fixed enemies "fleeing" after they have been shot. There was a steering issue when they targeted characters 
inside the sub while being outside.
- Fixed Hammerhead attack causing warping.
- Fixed incorrect submarine and level seed in server logs when playing campaign mode.
- Hide the start button from the campaign UI if the client doesn't have the permission to manage 
the campaign or rounds.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions:
- A major overhaul on the crew AI. They should now be much better at executing their tasks, keeping
themselves alive and less likely to get stuck.
- Re-enabled multiplayer campaign.
- New alien ruin art.
- New main menu (still a work in progress).
- New fonts.
- New subs and a new shuttle.
- New husk sprites.
- Improved item/character highlight effect.
- New signal items (divide, multiply, subtract, memory, equals, greater than, color, xor).
- Option to adjust microphone volume in multiplayer.
- Added a console commands for changing the gender and race of the character.
- More intuitive BrokenSprite condition logic: a BrokenSprite with a MaxCondition of 50 will start 
fading in at 50 (and be fully visible when the condition drops to 0 or down to the MaxCondition of 
the next BrokenSprite).
- Added Mirror X/Y buttons to editing HUDs and tooltips that tell about the keyboard shortcuts.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Improved item position syncing logic. Less warping or items being impossible to pick up due to
being in a different position server-side.
- Fixed clients not sending a network update to the server when dragging an item out of an inventory
slot, causing situations such as suffocation after dropping a diving suit due to the server not
knowing that you'd dropped it.
- The client hosting a server and spectators don't trigger autorestart.
- The owner of a server is allowed to spectate even if spectating is disallowed in server settings.
- Fixed "play yourself" always toggling to true when a round ends.
- Fixed missing item names in the extra cargo menu.
- Fixed traitor rounds failing to start if the server is not hosted by a client.
- Fixed console command aliases not being taken into account in GameClient.HasConsoleCommandPermission 
(meaning that the client needed a permission for each name variant of a command, making it impossible 
to for example use "fixwalls" instead of "fixhulls").
- Made the "control" console command usable to clients. 
- Show the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby even if the client has the permission to start 
the round.
- Fixed server lobby screen not showing the names of the submarines the client doesn't have.
- Fixed inability to select the respawn shuttle as a client host.
- Fixed VoipCapture creating new "could not start voice capture" popups constantly if there's no 
suitable capture device.
- Fixed crashing when starting a round if a submarine name contains underscores.
- Fixed clients console errors when attempting to modify the properties of an ItemComponent in-game
(for example, the color of a light component).
- Added some more information to the console messages and error popups when a client gets disconnected.
- Fixed enablecheats command crashing the server if it's used when there are no clients present.

Misc bugfixes:
- Audio fixes (less snap, crackle and pop).
- Fixed particle "jitter" when the submarine was moving fast.
- Fixed damage modifiers affecting all afflictions if they use affliction types instead of affliction 
identifiers. 
- Fixed end round vote text going outside the screen if there's a 2-digit amount of votes.
- Fixed StatusEffects only applying afflictions to one limb even if the target is "Character" instead of "Limb".
- Disable audio instead of crashing if no audio device is found.
- Fixed item interfaces getting repositioned every frame when the editing HUD is open.
- Fixed held items clipping with the sleeves of the character (e.g. when holding a revolver while an 
uniform is equipped).
- Fixed being able to levitate by spamming the ragdoll button.
- Fixed dead characters draining oxygen tanks inside diving suits/masks.
- Fixed reactor gauges getting messed up if the optimal fission rate is more than 100% (which may happen
if the power consumption is larger than what the reactor can generate).
- Fixed mud raptors not having an inventory (nor lootable items).
- Fixed inability to interact with any items when aim assist is set to 0%. 
- Fixed info panel flickering out and Tab getting "inverted" (= info panel shown when tab is not being held) 
when selecting crew members in the panel.
- Fixed characters arms occasionally getting stuck above their shoulders.
- Fixed wire nodes occasionally being created at the wrong end of a wire (e.g. when moving a wire between 
connections in a connection panel, the wire stretched from the device at the other end of the wire to 
the device that's being rewired).

Misc:
- Changed the way arguments are given to the "setclientcharacter" command (no semicolon to separate the 
names, quotation marks have to be used for multi-word names just like with any other command).
- Show the amount of credits in the crew tab of the campaign menu.
- Don't spawn new monsters if docked to the start outpost or within 50 meters of the start/end of the level.
- The diving knife now causes also internal damage besides bleeding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes:

- Fixed chatbox retaining the radio message prefix after being deselected.
- Push-to-talk doesn't trigger when typin in a text box.
- Fixed some server log messages and texts sent to clients being incorrect (= showing the tags that are
used to fetch the texts from the language files instead of the actual texts).
- Fixed AI orders that target a specific item (such as the order to power up the reactor) not working in
multiplayer.
- Fixed crashes when attempting to use voice capture or change voice capture settings when there are no 
suitable capture devices available.
- Fixed clients not being notified when an AI character shuts down the reactor.
- Fixed deconstructors staying active without power in multiplayer.
- Fixed sonar labels going outside the screen when at the left side of the display.

Additions & changes:
- Added some supplies to vanilla submarines.
- Balanced item deterioration rates and adjusted neutral ballast settings in vanilla subs.
- Increased the impact tolerance of crawlers to prevent them from killing themselves by bumping into walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer improvements:
- Got rid of the listen server: when hosting as a client, the game actually runs the dedicated server executable
in the background. Makes client-hosted servers a little smoother due to the better performance of the dedicated
server, and also makes it much easier for us to maintain and test the multiplayer because we no longer have
two separate server applications.
- Added multiplayer campaign.
- VOIP support! Still a work in progress, so minor audio glitches are to be expected.
- Improved character and submarine position syncing. Way less rubberbanding and teleporting!
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when autorestarting or starting by voting.
- Fixes players being unable to log in as a client when they're hosting a dedicated server on another machine.
- Option to randomize your job preferences in the server lobby.
- Fixed a server timing issue that occasionally caused the server to kick clients due to desync when a round starts.
- Fixed occasional server-side "maximum packet size exceeded" errors.
- Require the players to either dock with the ending outpost or to get the sub close and enter the outpost before 
automatically ending the round.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing if the round ends while the health window is open.
- Fixed incorrect item panel positioning in the crew command interface when the sub is docked to something. 
- Fixed crashing when an incompatible content package is selected in config.xml or if the content package 
cannot be found.
- Fixed screen distortion effects on Linux.
- Fixed non-character key input on Linux (arrow keys, tab, etc).
- Fixed fullscreen option not taking effect on game launch.
- Fixes to a bunch of crashes in the character editor.
- Fixed subinventories not being displayed on the inner clothes slot, making it impossible to use the extra
slots in uniforms.
- Fixed game settings resetting every time the game is updated.
- Fixed bots shooting at their own crew with turrets.
- Fixed wifi components not receiving chat messages in single player.
- Fixed AI not reloading coilguns if an empty box of ammunition is inserted in the loader.
- Fixed incorrect deusizine scale.
- Fixed turret light toggle not doing anything.
- Fixed character skills that aren't defined in the job xml never increasing, resulting in all jobs except 
the captain always having a helm skill of 0.
- Fixed flashlight & scooter light cones being "clipped".
- Fixed StatusEffects bypassing limb damage modifiers.
- Fixed waypoints not getting connected between docking ports on some subs.
- Fixed target identifiers being bypassed when a StatusEffect is set to target nearby items or characters.
- Fixed the "insufficient skills to use the item" text popping up if a character doesn't have sufficient 
skills to operate one of the item's components, even if the component was not interacted with (e.g. captains 
got a warning about not being able to use the connection panel of a nav terminal, even if they didn't select 
the connection panel).

Steam Workshop:
- Update installed workshop items automatically on startup.
- Allow adding submarines to workshop items with the "add file" dialog.
- If creating an update for a workshop item that's currently installed, use the installed version instead 
of the one downloaded from the workshop.

Additions:
- Some new random events.
- A bunch of new afflictions and medical items.
- Some new item sprites.
- A couple of new cargo missions.
- Added some new items that can be crafted from alien materials.
- Display linked hulls as one room on the status monitor.
- Tons of new sound effects.
- Display the controlled character in the crew interface.
- Option to "give orders" to the character you're controlling. In single player it can be useful if you want 
the controlled character to keep doing something when switching to another one, in the multiplayer it can be 
used to let others know what you're doing.
- Added a weak spot to Moloch's bladder.
- Baby Moloch, doo doo doo doo doo doo 
- Added damage particles to Mud Raptors and Molochs.
- Added "minimum velocity" property to to motion sensors. Allows making sensors that, for example, keep a door open 
when a character is standing in the doorway.
- Option to choose whether to use AND/OR logic in StatusEffects with multiple conditionals. Defaults to AND.
- Added a 1 second "cooldown" to water detector state switches to prevent alarms from toggling on and off constantly 
when the water level is fluctuating around the position of the detector.
- Added scram option (reactor shutdown) to the nav consoles in the vanilla subs.
- Support for binding Mouse4, Mouse5 and MouseWheel.
- Made Hammerhead and Mudraptor attracted to light. 
- New husk sprite (still WIP).

Misc:
- Decreased deterioration rates across the board. Repairing a damaged item to full condition also now resets
the deterioration delay, meaning that the item will not start deteriorating again immediately after it's been
repaired.
- Miscellaneous optimization.
- Removed the info button from the top-left corner - the info menu is now opened with TAB.
- Changed default chat/radio keybinds to T and Y.
- Welding tools repair all the walls within the range of the raycast, not just the first wall the raycast hits. 
Makes it easier to repair overlapping and multi-layered walls.
- Decreased the range of passive sonar - previously there was often no reason to use the active sonar because
the passive mode showed the area around the sub so clearly.
- Health scanner shows all active afflictions (not just those that are visible in the health interface). 
Allows detecting afflictions at an earlier stage, making the item much more useful.
- Nerfed the structure damage done by Molochs and Crawlers.
- Reduced creature HP across the board.
- Increased the amount of minerals in levels.

that always does burn damage.
- Made headsets craftable.
- Battery output doesn't start dropping until the charge is below 10%.
- Restrict the amount of power going through relay components to the MaxPower value of the relay.
- Set Humpback reactor output a bit higher, batteries now start at full charge and relays can't be overloaded.
- Miscellaneous fixes and balancing to vanilla subs.

- Fixed status effects with a ReduceAffliction value of 0 freezing the game.
- Fixed sliders not moving in the battery/supercapacitor interface when an AI character is operating it.

instead of "file123 (2).txt").
- Fixed battery positioning in charging docks.
- Fixed crashing when ending a single player round while a character is outside the sub.
- Fixed "attempting to remove an already removed item" console errors when ending a round.
- Fixed fire sounds persisting in menus.
- Fixed the layout of the extra cargo menu in server settings.
- Fixed depth charges disappearing from loaders when interacting them with both hand slots full.

and most likely other issues with item StatusEffects as well. 
- Artifacts spawn in artifact holders again.
- Fixes to "attempted to move pulljoint extremely far" errors which occasionally caused severe problems
in syncing characters' positions.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused monsters to spawn very close to the submarine in monster missions.
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when automatically starting the game via 
autorestart or clients being ready. 
- Fixed up-to-date content packages being reported as incompatible in the Steam workshop menu.
- Changed the default radio chat hotkey to T.

- Added a little extra fuel to vanilla subs.
- Slowed down item deterioration rates.
- Moved the position of turrets in Orca and Typhon to prevent players getting caught under them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.1 (closed alpha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too many changes to list here. :) We've been working on this update for a year now, with a team of about 
a dozen people (as opposed to a couple of devs working on it on their free time).

Almost every aspect of the game has been improved to some extent - some polished a bit, some went through 
a more major overhaul and many things are completely new.

This is by no means a complete list, but here's some of the new things:

- A full graphics overhaul: almost all of the sprites has been polished or completely remade.
- Improved random event system that tries to keep the overall difficulty of the game at certain level,
delaying additional monster spawns if there's already lots of things going on, or spawning more when 
there's a more quiet moment.
- Improved difficulty system: now the difficulty level has a much more noticeable effect on the gameplay.
- General difficulty balancing all across the board: we've tried to make the difficulty curve more approachable
to new players while still keeping things challenging for more experienced players on higher difficulty levels.
- More varied levels, environmental hazards.
- A new more detailed health system with things such as limb-specific injuries, addictions, overdoses, 
mental issues... The system is also highly moddable, and makes it much easier to implement things such as
hunger mechanics, more varied poisons or stat-boosting items.
- Completely redesigned in-game HUD (the inventory, crew command interface, chat, etc).
- Redesigned crafting system.
- Minerals scattered across the level (can be used for crafting).
- A command/report system that can be used to communicate with your crew more effectively (in both single 
player and multiplayer).
- Tons of additions to alien ruins (traps, puzzles, non-flooded rooms).
- Improved AI (both the crew AI and the enemy AIs).
- NPC dialog (including random chatter and context-specific lines that make it easier to keep track of 
what the crew is doing).
- Most of the device interfaces have been redesigned to make them easier to use (and nicer to look at!).
- Many additions to the campaign mode (still a work in progress though).
- Overhauled the skill system: now every character can generally do anything (repair devices, fabricate 
new items, apply medical treatments), but characters with higher skill levels will do things more efficiently.
- Skill progression in the campaign mode: characters' skills gradually increase, making them more valuable with 
each completed round.
- New music composed specifically for the game.
- Overhauled audio.
- New monsters.
- New items (weapons, tools, medical items, alien items, crafting materials, etc).
- A completely remade tutorial.
- Too many bugfixes to count.
- Improved and much more stable ragdoll animations.
- Additional tools for modders (character editor, sprite editor, level editor, additions to the submarine editor).
- Steam functionality of course: full Workshop support, achievements, banning Steam IDs from servers...
- Improved translation support: it's possible to translate texts in item/job/etc configuration files without
breaking compatibility with existing subs or mods (see the EnglishVanilla file for some instructions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clients can now join servers that have an IPv6 address.
- Added "unban" and "unbanip" commands.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to apply an invalid force/impulse to a physics body"
errors.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to move a pulljoint extremely far" errors.
- Fixed DebugConsole selecting non-command lines if up/down is pressed when there are no commands in the 
console. 
- Fixed inventory syncing not working on the controlled character's inventory if the character is 
unconscious or wearing handcuffs.
- Verify that the launched exe belongs to the currently selected content package when starting up the game.
- Fixed console messages that have been created before initializing the debug console not being present
in crash logs. Made it difficult to diagnose crashes that occur immediately when the game starts.
- Additional error logging to diagnose SharpDX errors on startup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.
- Fixed conditionals being ignored on delayed status effects.
- Fixed clients staying in an unsynced state if they rejoin while their character is dead or unconscious,
causing the camera not to follow the character and preventing the player from giving up.
- Fixed LightComponent sprites and broken device sprites not being mirrored in mirrored subs.
- Fixed a few ragdoll animation bugs that caused "attempted to move pulljoint anchor extremely far" errors.
- Fixed AI characters (most often mantises) being able to attack through walls.
- Fixed alien ruins occasionally overlapping with each other or being above the upper boundary of the level.
- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs. 
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the 
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass 
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with 
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).
- Fixed characters occasionally getting teleported outside the sub for a few frames when moving between 
docked subs.
- Fixed status effects that deplete oxygen affecting characters that don't need air to breathe.
- More error logging to diagnose syncing errors.
- Melee weapons can only hit one character per swing (makes stun batons and medical syringes less OP).
- Option to make RegEx component only send a signal when it receives a signal (not continuously according 
to the last received signal).
- Added FalseOutput property to RegEx components.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Husks or huskified humans don't gain health by attacking corpses.
- Fixed dragged characters occasionally getting launched away at a high speed when moving from sub to
another.
- Fixed dragged characters staying floating mid-air after they've been dragged up/down ladders.
- Attempt to fix items occasionally dropping client-side when moving them from an inventory to another.
- Fixed incorrect rotation of welding tools and other 2-handed items that are held in one hand when not 
aiming. The items were rotated according to the left hand, but positioned on the right hand.
- Spaces and exclamation marks are allowed in client names by default.
- Hitscan weapons like the revolver can hit targets outside the sub when firing from the inside and 
vice versa.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone linked submarines in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone items with non-default required items.
- Fixed autopilot being unable to navigate to the destination in mirrored levels.
- Ragdolls can't be dragged through walls or other colliders.
- Dropped flashlights don't consume and battery and turn off automatically.
- Oxygenite tanks can be stored in cabinets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Clients can be given access to server logs.
	- Respawn durations can be changed mid-round.
	- Servers have the option to disable the disguise feature.
	- Increased midround syncing timeout.
	
Misc changes:
	- Levels are mirrored when travelling through the backwards in the campaign mode.
	- Added colliders to railguns (so they cannot go through walls or enemy subs anymore).
	- Melee weapons can hit multiple targets on one swing. Fixes weapons occasionally  not hitting 
	the target in tight spaces due to touching the ceiling/walls first.
	- The voltage required for a PowerTransfer item to take damage and the probability for a fire can be 
	configured in the item xmls.
	- Docking ports and hatches aren't damaged by excess voltage.
	- Added more color variants of wires.
	- Characters point the harpoon gun down when not aiming.
	- Added parameter autocompletion to the kill command.
	- Added a property that can be used to lock connection panels but still keep the panel rewireable 
	in the submarine editor.
	- Items outside the sub cannot be deattached from walls.
	- Fabricators show the list of required items even if the character does not have the skills to craft 
	the item.

Networking bugfixes:
	- Fixed file transfers failing if the client disconnects during an active transfer, rejoins and 
	attempts to receive the same file.
	- Fixed a bug in door syncing that caused the door states to differ between the server and clients 
	in some	subs with more complex door wiring setups.
	- Fixed clients being able to spam kick votes (duplicate votes were not counted but caused unnecessary 
	chat messages to be sent).
	- Fixed item conditions occasionally not matching exactly between the server and clients, causing 
	issues such as not clients not being able to fabricate items due to the condition being slightly 
	below the minimum condition at their end.

Bugfixes:
	- Added a workaround to a MonoGame bug that makes the screen turn white when alt-tabbing out of fullscreen.
	- Fixed docking ports flooding for no reason in some custom subs.
	- Fixed LightComponents staying active on broken items.
	- Fixed railguns and depth charge tubes being directly usable by characters (= they could be launched 
	simply by selecting them and left clicking, without the need to use a railgun controller).
	- Fixed items salvaged from ruins not being saved in the campaign mode.
	- Fixed LOS effect being brighter than the ambient light in some of the darker levels, causing 
	the player to see obstructed areas better than unobstructed ones.
	- Fixed severed limbs staying disabled when a dismembered character is revived using console commands.
	- Fixed characters holding non-aimable two-handed items such as railgun shells in one hand when aiming.
	- Fixed stereo sounds not being loaded correctly.
	- Fixed modified sprite colors not working correctly on worn items.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Made ambient lighting much darker and added a subtle glow around the player.

- Nerfed wall damage. Crawlers, mantises, threshers and coelanths now take much more time to tear through 
the hull and collisions with the level cause less damage.

Items:
	- Added syringe guns and a bunch of new chemicals.

	- Option to determine which types of targets a projectile can stick to.
	- Improved revolver hitscan logic.
	- Item descriptions can be changed in the submarine editor.
	- Characters can hold flashlights in their mouths.
	- Added an inventory slot for ID cards.

	show the name that's in the ID card the character is wearing. 
	- The owner of an ID card is stated in the description of the card.
	- Fabricating items requires the ingredients to have a specific minimum condition (can't use 
	already-used consumables to craft something).
	- Deconstructing an item that's not in a full condition may prevent some deconstruction products from appearing.
	- Optimized electricity/signal logic.
	- Grenades can be triggered by detonators.
	- Bought cargo spawns in containers instead of being scattered across the floor.

	weapons or hitting people with something while using the railguns.
	- Item editing menus display color values as 0-255 instead of 0-1.

	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output 
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

Multiplayer additions:
	- Added an optional "karma system". Harming other players, damaging structures and blowing up the reactor 
	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players 
	from choosing specific jobs

	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	secretly identify other traitors.
	- Added an option to make players spawn directly in the main submarine instead of the respawn shuttle.

	- Added a [PM] tag to private chat messages.
	- Fixed game over/round end music not playing when a round ends.

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.
	- Messagebox overflow fixes.
	- Fixed status effects not being able to decrease stun timers.
	- Fixed anti-husk medicine being able to reduce husk infection state after the infection has reached
	the active state.
	- Fixed monsters being able to spawn right next to the spawnpoint of the sub.
	- Fixed hulls not being linked to gaps if the center of the gap is exactly at the edge of the adjacent
	hulls.
	- Miscellaneous crew AI fixes.
	- Fixes to fast projectiles going through walls.
	- Fixed structure damage sounds not being played when a structure is fully destroyed.
	- Fixed glass windows using wrong sound effects.
	- Fixed carrier's light falling off when it dies.
	- Fixed incorrect positioning of debug console question prompts.
	- Fixed being able to use a wrench on multiple items at the same time.
	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections 
	to go through doors which prevented AI characters from opening them.

	- Fixed particles going through closed gaps (e.g. closed doors).
	- Fixed submarines being able to enter ruins.
	- Fixed collisions between a sub and the ruins not causing any damage to either the sub or the ruins.
	- Whitespace is ignored when calculating MD5 hashes for files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.
- Fixed content package setting not being saved in the settings menu.

- Updated the vanilla content package to version 0.7.
- Fixed entity linking in the submarine editor.
- Fixed railgun HUD crashing the game if the railgun is linked to an item that does not have an 
ItemContainer component (i.e. any item that can't contain other items).

- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters
invulnerable to small amounts of damage.
- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	a character turns into a husk).
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused swimming creatures to flip around constantly.
	- Fixed a bug that caused creatures to be able to sever limb joints that shouldn't be possible to sever,
	causing issues when attempting to sync the positions of the dead bodies.

	- Fixed inability to rebind keys to Mouse2 via the settings menu.
	- Fixed destroyed doors being impossible to repair.
	- Fixed creatures seeking towards an incorrect position when trying to eat something (causing larger

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.
- Fixed job assignment logic causing crashes if the maximum amount of players per job has been reached
on the top 3 preferences of a client (which can happen on modded servers that have several jobs with a 
player limit).
- Fixed errors during job assignment if a client or the host is controlling a non-human character.
- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific 
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the 
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed hulls not being rendered in the submarine editor.
- Crouching is synced between the server and the clients.

- Fixed null reference exceptions when syncing docking ports that haven't been docked to anything.
- Fixed invisible diving suits in some of the respawn shuttles (specifically ones where the suits spawn
directly on the floor).

- Tab doesn't autoselect the chatbox when the debug console is open.
- Fixed missing kick/ban buttons in the crew menu.
- Fixed a bug that caused ID mismatches in the hulls between docking ports. This caused, for example,
mysterious client-side fires around docking ports and "unknown object header" errors.

v0.6.1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed diving suits and masks not providing enough oxygen when in a low-oxygen room or outside the submarine.

	inside a medical syringe).
	- Logging which type of projectile was launched from a railgun and which items were contained inside it.
	- More descriptive wiring logging: the logs don't list all the wires in a connection panel but only 
	the changes players do to the wiring.

Monsters: 
	- Some creatures can hunt for smaller creatures (including humans) and eat them.
	- Tweaked enemy AI to make their attacks less likely to miss.

	- Option to make monster events spawn more monsters when previous ones are killed.
	- The camera zooms further out when controlling a large non-humanoid character.

Misc:
	- Improved item interaction logic: highlighting items is more precise, with items directly under 
	the cursor taking priority.
	- Characters can be dismembered by creatures and explosions.
	- New blood particles.
	- Blood, explosion and fire decals.
	- Added an artifact that attracts creatures.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Readded spam filter.
- Servers log the automatic temperature control setting of nuclear reactors.
- If a client fails to start a round (due to a missing sub file or an error, for example), their character

v0.5.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for multiple submarines (no full-fledged submarine vs submarine battles yet, but they're coming
in future updates!):
	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)
	- fixed monster inventory syncing (i.e. husk inventory syncing)
	- fixed server description box not being synced with clients
	- search bar for server logs
	- more server options
	- fixed the occasional "queue empty" error messages when attempting to send submarine files to players
	- characters can't be freely named anymore - they'll have the same name as the client

Items:
	- items can be equipped/unequipped by double clicking
	- longer railgun view distance
	- changes to the logic that determines which item is being highlighted - now it's much easier to
	select specific items in cramped subs
	- highlighted items glow (so it's easier to see which item you're targeting in the dark)
	- fixed an electricity bug that sometimes caused parts of the grid to not carry any power after 
	a junction box has been broken and repaired
	- option to choose the output of a signal check component when the signal doesn't match
	- fixed fire extinquishers
	- item search bar in the submarine editor

	- fixed flashes from explosions/sparks/flares occasionally ''staying on''
	- cameras: can be connected to a railgun controller (or any other selectable controller) to remotely
	view rooms or areas around the sub

Submarines:
	- the mass of a submarine depends on its size - larger submarines require more force to move around
	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)
	- changes to depth damage logic: structures with more health need more pressure before they start taking
	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

	- rewiring devices may cause electric shocks if the electrical engineering level is too low

Creatures:
	- some random "prop fish" swimming in the background
	- a new hostile creature

Misc:
	- a tutorial going through all the basic tasks and game mechanics (more in-depth tutorials will be
	added in future versions, including one for making custom subs)
	- an auto-updater in the launcher
	- the game generates a detailed report if it crashes
	- physics optimization (i.e. using simplified physics and animation for off-screen characters and 
	disabling them entirely if they're far enough)
	- lighting optimization (caching the lights/shadows if a light source hasn't moved instead of 
	recalculating them every frame)
	- two new background music tracks
	- better looking explosions
	- better looking water particle effects
	- minor UI improvements
	- better UI scaling on different resolutions
	- health/oxygen bar improvements and status icons for bleeding and water pressure	
	- gap-hull connections are visible in the sub editor
	- pumps don't have to be manually connected to a hull in the editor anymore, they automatically
	empty/fill the hull they're inside

	a harpoon, not the other way around)
