This mod includes a non-human character copied from a human. 
The mod can be used to test whether some normally human-only features work on a non-human character, for example:
- Giving the character a job, name and portrait.
- Giving talents to the character.
- Adding the character to the crew.
- Using human AI on a non-human.

When spawned, the character should behave and look the same way as a human character (depending on the team, it can either befriendly or hostile).
