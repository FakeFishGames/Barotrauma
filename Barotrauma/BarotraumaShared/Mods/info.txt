Modding info/tips:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	When doing an automatic update through the launcher, any old/unnecessary 
	files in the Content folder will be deleted. This also includes any new 
	files you may have added to the folder. 

	It is recommended to save all modifications to the ''Mods'' folder, or 
	in the case of custom subs, to the 'Submarines'' folder.

----------------------------------
Content Packages:
----------------------------------

	Content packages determine which configuration files the game will be using.
	This includes the configuration files for items, map structures, characters, 
	monsters and jobs.

	In the multiplayer mode, players are required to use the same content package
	as the server or they won't be able to join.

	If you are making a mod for the game, it is recommended to create a new content 
	package instead of just replacing existing files in the content folder. 
	This way you and anyone else using the mod can easily change between different
	mods and the vanilla version, without having to manually replace files in the
	Content folder or keep backups of different files.

	The content packages are configured in XML files which are saved in Data\ContentPackages. 

Example:

	A very simple content package could be configured as follows:

	<contentpackage name="BestModEver" path="Data/ContentPackages/BestModEver">
		<Item file="Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Human/Human.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Cthulhu/cthulhu.xml" />
		<Character file="Content/Characters/Crawler/crawler.xml" />
		<Structure file="Content/Map/StructurePrefabs.xml" />
		<Jobs file="Content/Jobs.xml" />
		<RandomEvents file="Mods/BestModEver/randomevents.xml" />
		<Executable file="Barotrauma.exe" />
	</contentpackage>

	This content package would replace all the items in the game with whatever items are
	configured in the "Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" file. It would also use a modified
	version of the human characters and have all the monsters in the game replaced with
	crawlers and Cthulhus. The random events have also been changed - perhaps by adding
	a new event that spawns Cthulhu and removing the events that spawn monsters/items
	which aren't included in the mod.

----------------------------------
Creature modding:
----------------------------------

	All the creatures/characters in the game are configured in XML files.

	The XML files should be formatted in the following way:
	<character name="something">
	   <ragdoll attribute1="something" attribute2="something">
	   
		  <limb id = 0>
			 <sprite texture="texturepath" sourcerect="0,0,width,height"/>
			 <attack type="something"/>
		  </limb>
		  
		  <limb id = 1>
			 <sprite texture="texturepath" sourcerect="0,0,width,height"/>
		  </limb>
		  
		  <joint limb1="0" limb1anchor="x,y" limb2="1" limb2anchor="x,y"/>      
	   </ragdoll>
	   
	   <ai attribute1="something" attribute2="something"/>
	</character>

	------------------------------------------

	Elements:

	Character:
	   - has to be the root element of the file

	   Attributes:
		  name: the name of the creature
		  humanoid: true/false, if set to true the character is animated using
			 a bipedal animator (like humans)
		  needsair: true/false, does the character drown/suffocate without
			 oxygen (false by default)
		  drowningtime: how fast the character drowns (in seconds)
		  doesbleed: if set to false, the character takes no bleeding damage
		  health: self explanatory (100.0 by default)      
		  
	Ragdoll:
	   - has to be a child element of the character element
	   
	   Attributes:
		  headposition: how high from the ground the head of the character should
			 be when the character is standing (50.0 by default)
		  headangle: an angle which the head is rotated to when the character is walking
			 (0.0 by default, meaning that the head will face straight forward)
		  torsoposition: same as headposition but for torso (50.0 by default)
		  torsoangle: an angle which the torso is rotated to when the character is walking
			 (0.0 by default, meaning that it will face straight forward)
		  waveamplitude, wavelength: if the character is not a humanoid, it will
			 do a "wave-like" swimming movement with the selected amplitude and
			 wavelength. To put it simply, amplitude affects how large up-and-down
			 movement the character will do and wavelength affects how fast the
			 character does the movement (both 0.0 by default)
		  flip: should the entire character be "mirrored" over the y-axis when it
			 switches its movement direction from left to right or vice versa,
			 or should it just rotate along the z-axis (false by default)
		  walkspeed, swimspeed: how fast the character should move on land and
			 in water, (the actual speeds are also affected by the weight, shape
			 and steerforces of individual limbs) (both 1.0 by default)
		  swimspeed: how fast the character should move in water
	   
	Limb:
	   - an individual part of the ragdoll
	   - has to be a child element of the ragdoll element
	   
	   Attributes:
		  id: an integer that is used to distinguish between limbs when connecting them
			 with joints. The first limb should have the id "0", the second "1" and so on.
		  radius, width, height: used for setting the dimensions of the physics body
			 of the limb. If only radius is set, the limb will be a circle with
			 the selected radius. If width and height are set, it will be a rectangle.
			 If radius and height are set, it will be a capsule.
		  density: the mass of the limb will be area_of_the_limb * density (default 10.0)
		  friction: the friction coefficient of the limb (0.3 by default)
		  flip: true/false, if set to true the limb will be "flipped" from one side
			 to another when the character turns around (as in, if a character is
			 facing left and has an arm extended left, the arm will be extended
			 to the right when the character faces to the right) (false by default)
		  ignorecollisions: true/false, should the limb collide with walls (true by default)
		  impacttolerance: if the limb receives an impact larger than this value, it takes
			 damage (20.0 by default)
		  type: determines how the limb should be animated and what kind of items can be
			 equipped on the limb. Can be set to None, LeftHand, RightHand, LeftArm,
			 RightArm, LeftLeg, RightLeg, LeftFoot, RightFoot, Head, Torso, Waist, Tail,
			 Legs, RightThigh or LeftThigh
		  pullpos: when animating the character, forces will be applied to this
			 point of the physics body of the limb. Defaults to "0.0, 0.0" which
			 is the center of the limb.
		  refjoint: index of the joint that is used as the "center point" along
			 the x-axis when doing a walking animation. For example, if the joint
			 between a characters thigh and  waist is set as refjoint, the feet of the
			 character will be moved directly under said joint when the character is
			 standing still.
		  steerforce: how much force is applied to the limb when the character moves (0.0 by default)
		  armorsector: an armored sector between two angles (in degrees). For example,
			 -90,90 would make the front sector of the limb armored (0.0,0.0 by default)
		  armor: how effective the armor is: damage is divided by this value if an attack hits the
			 armored sector (1.0 by default)
		  
	Sprite:
	   - a child element of a limb element
	   
	   Attributes:
		  texture: file path of the texture
		  sourcerect: which part of the texture should be used. If either width or
			 height are 0, they will be set to the width or height of the texture.
			 (0,0,0,0 by default)
		  origin: what point in the sprite is considered the "middle point". "0,0"
			 is the upper left corner of the sprite and "1,1" the lower right
			 corner. ("0.5, 0.5" by default)
		  depth: Affects the order which sprites are drawn in. Sprites with a
			 depth of 1.0 will be drawn under sprites that have the depth set
			 to 0.9 for example. Note that setting several limbs to the same
			 depth value may cause them to "flicker" on top of each other, so
			 it's recommended that every sprite has a slightly different depth.

	Attack:
	   - a child element of a limb element
	   
	   Attributes:
		  type: affects the logic for moving the attacking limb. At the moment the only
			 types are None, PinchCW and PinchCW

			 PinchCW: the limb rotates clockwise when attacking (or counter-clockwise
				if the character is facing left). Useful for attacks like biting
				or slashing
			 PinchCCW: the same as PinchCW, but in the limb is rotated in the
				opposite direction
			 Hit: the limb will "punch" the target

		  damage: damage done to other characters (0.0 by default)
		  bleedingdamage: how much the attack affects the bleeding rate (0.0 by default)
		  structuredamage: damage done to structures (0.0 by default)
		  stun: how long the target is stunned (in seconds, 0.0 by default)
		  range: how close the limb doing the attack has to be to the target to do damage
			 (0.0 by default, but should be set to a higher value or otherwise it
			 will only do damage if the limb is exactly at the position of the target,
			 so practically never)
		  duration: how long the attack lasts - if set to zero, it will be a "one-hit"
			 attack, otherwise it will be active for a while and the damage values
			 will be damage per second
		  priority: can be used for adjusting how likely the character is to use specific
			 attacks. For example, if a character has two attacks, first one
			 having the priority 2.0 and the second 1.0, the character is twice as
			 likely to use the first one.
		  
	Joint:
		- a revolute joint connecting two limbs to each other
		- a child element of the ragdoll element

		Attributes:
		  limb1, limb2: thes id of the limbs that should be connected
		  limb1anchor, limb2anchor: the points where the joint is attached to on
			 the limbs (0.0, 0.0 being the center)
		  lowerlimit, upperlimit: how much the joint can turn. If both are set to 0.0,
			 the joint can rotate freely.

	(A more extensive tutorial coming up in the future)

	Items are also configured in XML files. An item consist of several ''components''
	which determine the functionality of the item. See the existing item files for
	examples on the components.
