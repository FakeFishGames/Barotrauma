General
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This folder is the place where mods installed from the Steam Workshop go.
	You should also place your own mods in this folder, under a separate
	subfolder (e.g. "Mods/MyMod").

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content Packages:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Content packages determine which configuration files the game will be using.
	This includes the configuration files for items, map structures, characters, 
	monsters and jobs.

	In the multiplayer mode, players are required to use the same content package
	as the server or they won't be able to join.

	All mods published in the Steam Workshop need a content package.

	If you just want to publish a custom submarine in the workshop, you
	don't need to worry about content packages - you can just select the 
	submarine from the "Publish item" tab in the Workshop menu, and the
	game automatically creates a folder and content package for your mod.

Example:

	A very simple content package could be configured as follows:

	<contentpackage name="BestModEver" path="Mods/BestModEver/BestModEver.xml" gameversion="0.9.1.0" corepackage="true">
		<Item file="Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Human/Human.xml" />
		<Character file="Mods/BestModEver/Cthulhu/cthulhu.xml" />
		<Character file="Content/Characters/Crawler/crawler.xml" />
		<Structure file="Content/Map/StructurePrefabs.xml" />
		<Jobs file="Content/Jobs.xml" />
		<RandomEvents file="Mods/BestModEver/randomevents.xml" />
		<Executable file="Barotrauma.exe" />
	</contentpackage>

	This content package would replace all the items in the game with whatever items are
	configured in the "Mods/BestModEver/items.xml" file. It would also use a modified
	version of the human characters and have all the monsters in the game replaced with
	crawlers and Cthulhus. The random events have also been changed - perhaps by adding
	a new event that spawns Cthulhu and removing the events that spawn monsters/items
	which aren't included in the mod. 

	It is also set to be used with the version 0.9.1.0 of the game.
