- [ ] I have searched the issue tracker to check if the issue has already been reported.

**Description**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Steps To Reproduce**
If possible, describe how the developers can get the bug to happen (for example, "the game crashes when I try to put handcuffs on a Moloch"). Please also mention whether the bug happened in a multiplayer or single player session. It is often extremely hard to fix a bug if we don't know how to reproduce it.

**Version**
Which version of the game did the bug happen in. Also, please include the operating system you're using (Windows/Linux/Mac).

**Additional information**
Add any other context about the problem here. If the bug always occurs in a specific save file or submarine, attaching the file to the report makes it much easier for us to diagnose. Since GitHub doesn't allow attaching the .sub or .save files to reports directly, you need to .zip them first.
