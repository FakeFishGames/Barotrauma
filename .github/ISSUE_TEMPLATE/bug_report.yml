        Thanks for taking the time to report a bug! Actionable reports are very important in identifying and fixing bugs, so please fill out all the fields carefully and provide as much information as you can while being concise. Please also note that we get lots of reports and may not always write back to each individually â€“ that does not mean we have not read it.

        If possible, describe how the developers can get the bug to happen (or, in other words, what actions lead to you encountering the bug). **This is by far the most important part of the report** - it is often extremely difficult, or even impossible, to diagnose an issue if we don't know the conditions it occurs in.
        If you have a save, a submarine file, screenshots or any other files that might help us diagnose the issue, you can attach them here. Note that GitHub doesn't support the .save or .sub file extensions, so you should .zip those types of files to allow them to be attached.

        1. Start a multiplayer campaign
        2. Spawn a bike horn with console commands
        3. Use the bike horn
        4. Observe how the game crashes

      description: If the game produces any text relevant to your issue, please include those in full. You can copy error messages from the in-game console by right clicking the error and selecting "copy". Crash reports will be named crashreport.log or servercrashreport.log and they're automatically generated into the root of the game's installation folder on your computer. You can usually find the game files location through Steam (Right click Barotrauma in your Steam Library -> Properties -> Local files -> Browse local files).
